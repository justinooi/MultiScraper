1, My baby couldn't use these at all. 
1, The nipples on bottles constantly collapse and make it hard for my baby to get milk. Also the nipples are pretty hard and not like a real nipple. 
1, Disappointed with this set and my baby hates these bottles! Whenever he sucks from them the nipple totally caves in & he can hardly get the milk out!! Don't waste your money 
1, Bought this for my newborn because description says extra slow flow (size 0) but it came with size 1 nipples. Didnt realized that until i sanitized the bottle and fed my baby that gulped and chocked when drinking. Please change your head description. 
1, I will never understand these. It is impossible to get the last drops out of the bottle even when turned entirely upside down. Used them maybe three times before I got mad enough about wasted breast milk and went back to the bottles I started with. 
1, Terrible. The flow is way to slow. Even when squeezing it with my fingers it doesn’t even drip. I do not recommend. 
1, This is not extra slow! It squirts out as soon as you turn it upside down. Alao not liking the shape as it doesn’t let all the milk go toward the tip! 
1, These bottles sadly did not work at all and actually seemed to worsen the digestive issues/crying/gas. This was after several attempts at using them and sterilizing them twice to ensure they were clean. I had to discard these bottles. They were a waste of money for me. I’m glad others have had some success. 
1, My son would not take these bottles. We tried around 1 month old. He choked on them despite that they were the slowest flow and had difficulty latching. The last ounce wouldn't come out waste of breast milk. The nipple seems stiff and oversized. We had better luck with the Nuk Natural bottles. 
1, Bought these for my newborn baby..the nipped are horrible 
1, I had three issues with these:1. These had a free promo label on them. So buyer received them for free and I paid for them2. The nipple was label 1 when I ordered extra slow3. Just didn’t work for my son 
1, I paid almost $7 for this bottle and when i got it it was labeled as a free sample. Kind of irritating. 
1, I have no idea why these are so well rated. The bottles are garbage.They come with super slown flow nipples that will likely starve your baby. Our newborn spent 20 minutes working on one of these and got less than a quarter of an ounce out. I had to take a tooth pick and use the tip to stretch the opening and even still it takes about 30 minutes for our baby to take an ounce of milk. On the upside shes gotten way better at nursing as a result because she has to work so hard to get anything out or a bottle.The second reason these bottles are terrible is their shape doesn't allow all the milk to come out. You can take the lid off and fully invert the bottle and you'll still have 5-10L stuck in the lip of the bottle.Total waste of money. 
1, I selected Extra Flow slow “ as it says in the title ” as my newborn have issue even with slow flow but instead I got 1 totally time wasted. 
1, Tried boiling it for less than 5min to sterilize it and it melted 
1, was looking for bottles that my son could tolerate without choking but it leaks so bad I'm not about to waste expressed breastmilk with a junky design that soaks my baby. 
1, I wouldn’t suggest ordering this item. This was ordered as a gift and it arrived with the box completely demolished. 
1, These bottles are garbage. They clog way too easily. One of the bottles even clogged for a first time use. Terrible for my preemie baby. Sticking with Dr. Brown's because it just works 
1, Total waste of money ..didn’t work for us! 
1, It's really bad for one of them because my baby get nothing from the nipple. Even if you look at the nipple carefully it's hard to find the really hole for the milk come out. I will never recommend this product for feeding. Don't buy it！！！ 
1," There is an obvious design flaw with this bottle which I think every parent should know. I bought this for my newborn and immediately noticed a problem on the first use. The bottle resembles the shape of a human breast. But unlike other bottles this bottle has a bigger than usual ""cup size"". Human breast is soft but this is not. During feeding the hard bottle pushes against the baby's nose and hurts the baby. There is actually another design flaw with this bottle is that there is always a decent amount of milk left in the bottle after feeding. You can see from the product pictures that there is a deep groove in the middle of the bottle. And it is that groove that traps a large amount of milk. And for a newborn that amount Is critical for the newborn's growth. "
1, Nipple hole was too tiny would not allow any milk to go through. I could've purchased new nipples but I just purchased different bottles instead. 
1, These are the worst. We got them for our second baby and it takes almost 30 minutes for him to get just 1oz out of the bottle. No issue with breastfeeding or other bottles but these are terrible. Wish I could return them. 
1, I don't get why these bottles getting good reviews. The nipple hole is too small allowing a very very slow milk flow. 
1, I was excited to use these on my newborn after reading the reviews. Unfortunately I will no longer use these bottles. They are constantly getting clogged during the feed which leads my baby to get frustrated.It was a waste of money. 
1, I bought these bottles because I didn't like my old brand. However they leak and very quickly. I lost all the milk I pumped in the matter of minutes. I'm so sad. I verified that I closed the cap all the way. It still leaks and extremely rapidly. 
1, This was the most disgusting thing to receive used bottles. There was no where on there saying they were used! Gross gross gross 
1, for a bottle claiming to have the most breast like nipple it isn't all that different from a regular bottle. I wonder if these people have even seen a nipple not any different than a regular bottle. 
1, I purchased this extra set of bottles because my 3 week old does great with these ... but the nipples on these all collapse when she’s drinking ! The other sets of these I have do not do that ! Defective ! 
1, Nipple are getting twisted while feeding baby and lot of bubbles during feeding 
1, These bottles are unusable to me because of the misleading description at the top. The headline reads slow flow but if scroll down for the detailed description it says extra slow flow. So now I can’t even use them unless I buy new slow flow nipples. 
1, Inaccurate description 
1, Not a fan of these bottles. I would not waste my money on these so many other options similar prices. 
1, Nipples stop working after 4 weeks. Nipples collapse and some even stopped working all together and nothing comes out which results in upset baby and frustrated parent in the middle of the night. Would not recommend and will not be repurchasing. 
1, I don’t understand why the nipples cave in/collapse when being used. I want to love these but I can’t bc my baby can barely use them. 
1, I love this bottle but I was sent the wrong flow. I was sent extra slow flow and the description says slow flow. There is a huge difference and now I have to go through the trouble of returning this item and re-ordering the right one which I’m not even sure how to do when the description doesn’t match the merchandise!!! 
1, I’m now in a pinch. The description says it comes with slow flow nipples size 1. The bottles I received all had the EXTRA slow flow nipples (size 0). UGH!!!!! Going to daycare for the first time and now I have to scramble to get the right bottles. The size 0 is just to slow for my 5 month old he sucks then so hard they colapse and air can’t get in fast enough.Really wish I had read all these reviews. 
1, I ordered this for my newborn. The description says slow flow but extra slow flow arrived. I thought this may be a mistake so I ordered it again planning to return the initial one. It came as extra slow flow again! The extra slow flow is painfully slow and I don't use the bottles because of it. Now I ordered the slow flow nipples separately. 
1, Bought these after my como tomo bottles started giving out too much milk and choking baby. Thought it would solve the problem. The nipples were slow flow all right- too slow for baby. He ends up sleeping through his feeding and wakes up shortly thereafter crying for milk. Not buying these again. The silicone is also way too hard. Baby finally took to dr brown bottles and started sleeping peacefully. 
1, The nips collapse like crazy no matter what we do. And the plastic is so thin I feel like it was such a waste. My baby gets so frustrated with feeding time if we use tommee tippee. 
1, I really wanted to like these and for a couple of weeks I did after that I found my baby would start fussing while feeding and feedings were getting longer and longer but there was milk still in the bottle. Came to discover it was because the nipples weren't allowing her to get milk from them even I couldn't get milk from them just testing the temperature! I did a temporary fix by opening up the air vent with a pair of nail clippers while waiting on a new set of bottles (different brand) to arrive. Extremely disappointment because superficially I LOVE Tommee Tippee and have already bought the lids for these bottles and a set of pacifiers. 
1, Nipple caves every time baby tried these bottles. Even after making sure the valve was open. They are useless. 
1, These would have been perfect but my newborn sucks so hard it causes the nipple to cave in making these unusable. 
1, My exclusively breastfed baby finds this bottle impossible to latch on. The nipple is too long 
1, Nipple are messed up. My little guy has a hard time eating because the nipples keep getting sucked back into the bottle. I have to keep popping the nipple out. It's very frustrating that he can't drink his bottle . 
1, Flimsy and poor quality. Went back to Avent natural which are fantastic 
1," Bought these because it says these are slow flow nipples in the bottle description. However these are actually the ""extra slow flow"". Slow flow is nipple level 1; extra slow flow is nipple level 0. I need to buy the nipples separately now. Not sure how to contact the seller directly. "
1, The one pro with these bottles is that they are comfortable to hold. But I assume for that very reason it makes getting all the milk out of the bottle impossible. I ditched these because I was wasting formula. I also don't like how dingy the bottles become over time. When they're new they are bright and clear but over time they become dull and the plastic takes on a look that just makes them look dirty no matter how well they're cleaned. 
1," I bought these bottles because I was tired of washing all the pieces of the Dr. Brown bottles. After using these Tommee Tippee bottles I went right back to using the Dr. Brown with no more complaints about washing so many pieces. My daughter hated the nipple of the Tom. Tip. It's too small for her and her toungue would get in the way. Also the ""vent system"" is nonsense! My baby had a lot of gas while using these bottles. I don't recommend these at all. "
1, Baby suffered horrible gas due to bottles. We noticed there were air bubbles but everyone said that that's normal and to not close the lid so tightly. He was in constant pain pushing grunting crying out all the time. His face would turn beat red while pushing. He'd be sleeping all content and suddenly his arms would be thrown up in the air and he'd be screaming like he was being murdered. It was so bad my wife would cry because she felt helpless. We had tried using an Avent bottle to see if it was the Tommee bottle. No change. The doctor had us try everything from bicycle kicks to Mylicon and even put my wife on a strict diet to reduce intake of gassy foods (pumped milk). NOTHING! Every online advice or trick people had. Nothing worked! Then a lady who'd been watching kids all her life had us use her Dr. Brown bottles and instantly there was a difference. No air bubbles in the bottle and less spit up. Three days later everyone's sleeping through the night even baby! The poor exhausted guy could finally get some good sleep! Please do not by these bottles for your infant! No baby should go through what my son went through. It was so horrible I'm actually writing my first Amazon review. If it'll save one baby I will write this! 
2, Broke very easily 
2," I wanted to find something with options for compatible accessories (cleaning/sanitization pacifiers etc) and would work well along with breastfeeding (the plan was to supplement with 2 bottles at night and here and there while out running errands). Tommee Tippee seemed the best fit not only are their products easily available it had glowing reviews from users and is one of the most highly recommended bottles for breastfed babies. I am not happy with the decision to go with this brand. The ""super soft silicone"" nipples keep collapsing during feedings causing the bottle to leak horribly so I have to stop throughout feedings to fix the nipple and clean my baby's face (which is a total waste of expensive formula and upsets the baby to no end). The stage 1 nipples aren't slow flow at all my newborn is forced to swallow huge gulps and while I would prefer to go back to exclusively breastfeeding my baby has refused to take the breast more and more since we started using these bottles and will barely breastfeed at all anymore. "
2, They leak. Depends on your child the nipple is too long for mine and it trigger her gag reflex which caused her to choke on the milk. But my frustration is that i tried size 0 nipple and milk still leak all over during feeding. 
2, The nipple os too hardy for the baby. Is not Like a brest. 
2, I just didn’t like the overall design and quality 
2, For some reason these bottles overheat with bottle warmer. I like the brand in general. I have the colored bottle set also and I have no problem with them and baby likes them. 
2, These came highly recommend for my premie daughter I was super excited to get them and give them a try however she WILL NOT latch onto them. When I finally did get her to latch it took her like 40 minutes to drink 20ml doesn't work for us. We're back to using MAM bottles. 
2, Listing title says slow flow description says extra slow flow. These are not the same. It looks like there is no consistency in what people are getting. You get size 0 or size 1 at random. I was hoping for size 1 since this is only a couple dollars more then getting th nipples alone but got size 0 
2, Good bottles. However one of the four bottles received did not have a true level 0 extra slow flow nipple despite the labeling. Baby gagged on the fast flow so bottle was defective. Moms should check each bottle to confirm. 
2, I'll start off saying I do love these bottles. So easy to clean easy to hold they don't get dingy after washing.The size 0 nipples aren't actually size 0 though. I have bottles from previous purchases and these flow much faster. The 0 on the bottle looks different too. 
2, idk not in love 
2," My primary gripe with these bottles is the nipple flow rate. The ""0"" (extra slow flow for preemies and newborns) is so slow it took my baby about 15 minutes per ounce. When I upgraded him to the ""1"" (slow flow) he was suddenly chugging an ounce in about 3 minutes. Perhaps his sucking power had been strengthened by how slow the ""0"" is but it really felt like there should be something in between.Additionally these bottles are an odd wide shape that doesn't seem to ergonomically fit in the hand. Finally they don't have a straw system for reducing burps. At the end of the day I switched to a well-known brand with the straw system and my baby is much happier. The ""0"" in that brand had him drinking a 10-minute ounce and the ""1"" has him drinking a 5-minute ounce. "
2, The flow is not slow enough. Wish they had a preemie option like Dr brown. I have been on a search for a wide nipple bottle but none of the flows are slow enough. The bottles are nice and easy to use but my baby drowns in them and gets a tummy ache. I don’t want to pace feed 24/7 so back to Dr Brown ultra preemie nipples we go. 
2, These bottles are easy to hold while feeding but thats about all I liked about them. Every time I would shake up the formula it would immediately squirt out the nipple. 
2, These bottles should be marketed for premies. They were too slow flow for my full term newborn and put more air into her belly. 
2, Thought I would like the bottle but am gana stick with the once i use. 
2, This says it has slow flow nipples. It does not it has ultra slow flow. Huge world of difference and false advertising 
2, Ordered 2 sets one came with 1 flow nipples but the other came with 0 flow nipples. Didn't notice at first or would have sent them back. Baby wont drink from the 0 glove so had to buy new nipples. 
2, Stay away from these things!The teats collapse like crazy even if you press on the valve or if you manually open it. My baby falls asleep before he finishes his milk and ends up wanting to eat every hour. So frustrating! Also I have found that the bottle leaks so annoying to find my baby all wet from his chest due to the leaking bottle. I have no clue what the hype is about these bottles are horrible. 
2, I like that this product was small but I disliked that the nicole sucked inward as baby feed 
2, They kept leaking from my daughters mouths! The design just didnt work with my twins. I really did love it though. I dont breastfeed bc they never latch and i think thats the reason these bottles didnt work. 
2, The flow was almost too slow. It took almost 40 minutes to feed my baby 2 ounces of pumped milk. It was also hard to get the last of the milk into the nipple without turning it upside down and shaking it. Definitely not something I’ll buy again or recommend. 
2, Not the best design some milk gets trapped between the bottle top and the ring so you have to move it all around to get all the milk out. I got the low flow nipples and I don’t think they are. Baby sucks down his bottle in just a few minutes even with pace feeding. I do like that they’re lightweight and the shape of the nipple is good but now after using them about a month they leak milk all over his face so I’m not using them any more 
2," Received the items in good condition; however these are not ""low flow"" nipples but ""extra low flow"" - rated 0 instead of 1 as expected. Not at all clear from the product description online. "
2, We bought these along with a few others (avent nuk naturals Dr browns). These were or least favorite. The flow was not good for our newborn the milk would drip down her face. The milk would also get stuck on the ledge in the bottle. These things caused gas. We switched to nuk naturals and no issues 
2, I bought these because I wanted to use something other than Dr Browns (so many parts to clean). I wish they worked out but I returned them. The nipple kept collapsing despite troubleshooting and keeping the vent facing upwards. The nipple also felt really firm and clumsy and it didn’t have a slow flow. Overall my baby did much better with Dr Browns so even though they’re a pain to clean I will continue to use them rather than Tommee Tippee. 
2, The worst bottle for my baby. I have to change her completely after feeding her with this bottle. And you will be wasting precious breastmilk. Something not right with the design my daughter can collapse the nipple or had too much flowing that she chokes. 
2, Horrible for reflux. Made my son more gassy 
2, I like them but i dont because the numbers and oz came off and now idk how much milk is in the bottles 
2, At first these bottles were great but after a couple of weeks the nipples all started to collapse I'm not sure how to fix so I will likely have to switch his type of bottle which stinks because I really like everything else about them. 
3, Feel a little cheap the cap is really thin and so it’s the bottle itself it actually made me nervous to even want to boil 
3, Extra slow flow 
3, This is a great bottle and my daughter took it well however i really dislike that milk collects at the top of it because of its. Hape not all the milk can drop down properly 
3, My baby gets a lot of gas when I feed him with this bottle. 
3, These bottles came earlier than expected and are great quality; however the bottle is poorly designed in the fact that it is very difficult to get the last bit of milk out of the bottle. Also it was very confusing which size nipple I was going to get as it just says slow flow in the description and the Q&A says either 0 or 1 but I ended up getting a 1 and the flow is definitely NOT a slow flow nipple. My new born couldn’t even keep up with the flow. Very disappointed with the nipple size and because of the flow I’m unable to evaluate if the bottle is good since he keeps leaking from his mouth. So unless you are ok with getting the wrong size nipple I would order separate nipples to make sure you are getting the right size and maybe also overfill the bottle a little bit as when you measure 4 oz it’s probably only 3.8 oz that the baby is getting. 
3, My hubby bought these three 5 oz size 0 slow flow for our new born.He has been developed bad gas and acid reflux or just gas problem so he became colicky.This product isn't too bad but it still comes pretty fast and has only one air vent vs Comotomo brand 5oz size 0 slow flow bottle has double air vents. So I had to purchased the Comotomo to try and compare which one comes slower and decrease the bubbles/air for our son. 
3, This is the bottle that my newborn has been using so I decided to purchase another one but unfortunately it came with nipple size 1 when I believe it says nipple size 0 (extra slow flow). Disappointed with my purchase because now I have to reorder another one since nipple size 1 is too fast for my baby. 
3, Pros:-easy to hold-easy to clean-warms up very quickly in bottle warmer-breast like nippleCons (and the only thing that really matters lol):-wayyyyy too slow for my newborn. She gets tired after 1 ounce (which takes her 15-20 mins with this nipple) and then won't finish the rest because she's tired of sucking 
3, The nipple part of the bottle would invert a few times during feedings. It was just annoying to have to fix throughout. 
3, It’s great for a slow eater. My baby eats fast and he gets mad that the milk doesn’t come out fast enough. It’s good for a premature baby or a really SLOW eater. Other than that the bottle itself is cute and nice and small. 
3, The fact that the bottles arrived used is the reason I cannot have all positive things to say... I have used the tommie tippiee bottle before for my breastfed baby boy and the work great !! 
3, I really like these cute little bottles; but my newborn didn’t. I noticed that the nipple is a little too hard and my baby had a hard time sucking the milk out of it! 
3, New try .. easy to clean  but it’s OK ! I more like avent bottle， 
3, Already the ink on the bottles is sloughing off. My baby is 4 months old and I also breastfeed so it’s not like he’s just cycling through these three bottles. Interestingly enough the bottles I bought two weeks after these ones at buybuybaby aren’t losing the ink.... 
3, This is an ok bottle. Our baby did not end up doing as well with the “breast like” bottles as she did with another brand. Of the breast like bottles we tried this one was middle of the road.The nipple itself is a bit stiffer has a flat top unlike other brands which worked better for her. Also the shape of the bottle made it very difficult to warm up in a mug of hot water because it doesn’t fit (the top is super wide). I did not like using the bottles and did not think that the unique shape made it worth the annoyances. In fact this shape contributed towards its difficulty in use. 
3, These are EXTRA slow flow even though it says slow flow. Bottles are fine otherwise. 
3, Let me first start by saying that my baby is breastfed and now at 2 and a half months we are trying different bottles as I am going to have to return to work soon. These tommee tippee bottles are fine but the nipple flow is incredibly SLOW. My baby will fall asleep before finishing his bottle and gets very frustrated with these they are so slow. We have also used lansinoh momma bottles and Phillips avent natural bottles which he does fine with. These are just entirely too slow and I've already had to order the medium flow nipples to replace these. 
3, The bottles started out good for my twins and then we get to the end of the feeding and have to tip the bottle upside down and wiggle around to get the rest of the formula out. Babies do not like to wait for their food probably won’t keep using them. 
3, These bottles are great but this set comes with EXTRA Slow Flow not Slow Flow nipples!! 
3, I placed an order expecting the Slow Flow nipples However the product I received was Extra Slow Flow nipples. I brought this for a gift. 
3, Love the bottles but the numbers fade quick. I have used them for a month and hand wash once a day and the numbers are already fading. 
3, The nipple is great. The design is great. It is very breast like making it easy to switch between nursing and bottle feeding. The valve makes burping a less frequent task. The nipple occasionally leaks but I assume that's to be expected from any bottle.The bottle is awful. After about 2 weeks of use the ounce/mililiter marks started to rub off. Now a month after use (pictured) they're starting to get illegible. In about a month I likely won't be able to measure in the bottle anymore. 
3, Unfortunately my breastfed baby would not accept these bottles so we ended up using the Comotomos instead. I much prefer the price of these ones but baby doesn't care how much things cost. These are easy to clean and easy to hold though! 
3, We really thought these would work well for our baby as they seemed to look closer to a real breast as we are mostly nursing how ever we only used them one time . I'm not sure why but the leak a lot my parents tried to give us a little time alone and watch the kids for a few hours but had to come back because the bottle leaked all of the breast milk out. it is upsetting to know it went to waste. we have made sure the vent looks fine but it still leaks so we have three bottles we cant use now. 
3, We are trying these as a last ditch effort to get our baby to take a bottle! I like how soft the nipple is but it is almost too movable. Our 10 week old end up with the nipple sideways in his mouth and then gets mad. I am not a fan of how short and squatty the bottle is...it makes it hard to hold. Also we have used these maybe three times and the numbers are rubbing off the side! Not happy about that. Our baby will take these so that’s a plus but might not buy again due to the design and I would like to see how much milk is left. 
3, They shouldn’t say closer to mothers nipple because my baby hated these and she was almost strictly breastfeed. They caused her horrible colic and the large upper portion of the bottle kept my baby from getting all the milk out. We switched her to the Mam bottles and no longer had issues. 
3," These bottles and nipples are the only ones I have been able to get my daughter to use. However more important than nipple shape is the nipple flow. When I ordered the product the description said ""slow flow"" nipple (or level 1) which is what my daughter had been using. Theu arrived with ""extra slow flow"" nipples (level 0) which would frustrate my daughter who already had problems taking to the bottle. I have to spend more to get the nipples in the size the post says the bottles come with since they are needed in a few days for daycare. "
3, I liked that these bottles were easy to clean and didn't have too many complicated parts. I didn't experience leaks from the bottles themselves and the vent seemed to work fine (I followed instructions and made sure to give the vent a little pinch to open it up after washing). Unfortunately my baby didn't really like the nipple shape - the base was just too wide and he couldn't get the hang of it so he ended up dribbling milk everywhere. I think this is really baby-dependent and unfortunately there's no way to know ahead of time what they're going to like. 
3, We tried five different bottle brands and while these work better than most our one month old did best with Dr. Brown's. The flow on the Tommee Tippee bottles was too fast for our eager eater and bubbles would get trapped making for a grassier baby than usual. 
3, Don't really like these bottles Because they make our baby spit up too much Gets formula too fast 
3, The shape of the bottle makes it a little awkward when there is a small amount left. Baby has to be laying down in order to get all of the food. The vent works great though and I like the fact that there aren't multiple pieces to fuss with when cleaning. 
3, Hard to clean from the curves 
3, I love tommee tipper bottles its all I have ever used for all of my kids but these are disappointing. After 3 months of use all of the lettering has worn away. Now I can't see the ounce markings on the bottle. Disappointed. 
3," My BF baby likes the tommee tippee nipples so we went with these bottles. I have found that it's hard for baby to get all the milk out of the bottle due to shelf created by the wide ""shoulder"" of the bottle. This design could be improved but otherwise great product. "
3, The only thing I don't like this product is everytime when I warm it up it's always leaking. 
3, These are supposed to be slow flowing bottles so it doesn't cause too much nipple confusion while I'm breastfeeding too. My lil guy can finish 3oz in 5 minutes compared to if taking much longer while breastfeeding. 
3, I love these bottles! I bought a few of these and was afraid baby would not like them once we tried them I was relieved that baby loved them too!Follow up after a few weeks we decided to go with the Dr. Brown bottles even though our son like these they seemed to spill to much the flow was too fast for our son which caused him to take in more air and get gassy and het more colic. With the dr. Brown bottles he seemed to do better and we had less wet clothes and bibs to wash. 
3, Compared to Como Tomo bottles which also are structured to avoid nipple confusion for the infant: The nipple is thin and soft allowing for the baby to easily kink it when holding it at the wrong angle. The hourglass-like shape leaves some milk in the bottom half unless you shake it out by turning it upside-down completely making for an awkward feeding. The twist-on top is a little too smooth - It makes you worry if you tightened it enough to prevent leakage and hard to open when you have. It is light easy to hold (also for the infant) and cheap which makes for a good back-up bottle (e.g. for travel or when training baby to hold bottle on his/her own) just as long as your baby takes to the nipple shape. 
3, Didn't work for our breastfed baby. We needed something that allowed us to squeeze the milk in her mouth. 
3, I really like these bottles but I am giving three stars because maybe I received a bad batch. They don't stand flat. They wobble. It doesn't seem like much but when trying to measure out how much breastmilk is being poured into the bottle... it changes based on what way the bottle decides to wobble/lean. I have two boxes of these... one I got as a gift which all sit flat and then these that I purchased from amazon... which all wobble ?Other than the weird bottle defect these are great. My son was premature and he uses these fine. I breast and bottle feed him breastmilk with these and he can switch between the two with no problems. I don't breastfeed as often as I'd like because he has a bad tongue tie. These bottles help with the transition between the two. 
4, Only downside is is will sometimes leak when shaking it to mix formula otherwise great bottles. 
4, Offered this bottle to my newborn who has been breastfed and she accepted the bottle without so much of a fuss....it probably has to do with the sahpe of the nipple and the bottle....there haven't been any gas issues so far if anyone reading this review is concerned about the colic bitWhat i dont like is when you put the bottles in the dishwasher there's always some water stuck in the next of the bottle so that kinda makes it gross... 
4, Baby stopped spitting thanks to these bottles but their shape causes that not all milk gets to baby's mouth and it's just wasted 
4, A few things to know before buying...I bought 0 nipples and found out there are 2 size zero nipples 0+ (Extra slow) and 0 (Slow)*the amazon listing doesn’t clarify that! Their Personal website does and was much easier to order off of than Ama zon!My baby was gulping down here bottles. Even nursing she is a sloppy eater and will drinkTo fast and choke. We found she was getting gassy and spitting up often so I found these bottles and honestly loved them. Less air being swallowed and no choking down milk BUT i realized it was 0+ Extra Slow flow and it was way to slow. She was falling asleep and taking 10-15 min to drink and ounce. I purchased 0 nipples this morning to see if that will help her eat a bit faster and not work so hard.I will update this review once we try that out. 
4, Newborn is drinking from Phillips avent natural flow but milk leaks through the sides And I want something slower since I’m also breastfeeding. I’ll be comparing the two.Tommee tippee:- pretty easy to hold- flow is slightly slower than Avent- feeding time is longer (which is a good thing)- dries faster than the Avent after cleaning- The measuring dots are a little confusing- nipple is slippery than Avent so it does slips out of the mouth often which confuses me because it might could be the baby spitting/pushing it out because she’s full.- bottle feels a bit cheaper than Avent- (this doesn’t really matter) but the cap doesn’t have a nice click sound when closed and it’s hard to twist the top half with the cap on unlike Avent where you can easily twist them off togetherAvent:- nipple have a matte finish baby grips on it easier- comfortable to hold- Faster FlowI’m keeping both. I use Avent in the middle of the night when I want a quicker feeding time so we can both go straight back to sleep. I do notice she burps a lot more and chokes with Avent oppose to Tommee. Newborn isn’t nipple confused she still latches on while breastfeeding so these works for us. 
4, I did not like how the nipple of the bottle was too hard for a newborn but above all I think it’s more functional for a more mature baby. 
4, This was a gift for someone and the box was ripped other wise seem ok 
4, Love them until I saw them for 11.99 at Ross when I paid 18.99 here. 
4, Overall its a great bottle but the nipple is still not a slow enough preemie flow. We have been using a competitor's bottle with the super slow flow 0 month preemie nipple and wanted to try these and theyre not slow enough in comparison these seem more like newborn than preemie. 
4, Since my daughter was born we have tried numerous brands of bottles. We started off with the Nuk brand since they seemed to have great reviews. However she absolutely drowned and choked every time she used it. We then got the slowest flow nipples by Nuk and it was still too much for her and caused her to still choke on her milk and have terrible gas pains. We went on to a few other brands with the same issue of choking or eating way too fast (under 3 minutes) which defeats the point of pacefeeding since I am also breastfeeding. So we decided to use Tommee Tippee extra slow flow (0) and she no longer chokes or has gas pains. Now keep in mind that it's called Slow Flow for a reason. My husband got impatient that each feeding takes her about 15-20 minutes depending on how sleepy she is but I'd take that over her discomfort any day. My biggest gripe about these bottles are the space in between the bottle cap and the bottle itself. Even when twisted tightly shut there is a gap large enough for my 5-week-old to curl her fingertips into. I had a scare the other day when she managed to get the tip of her pinky stuck but luckily I noticed before I pulled the bottle away. I could've hurt her otherwise.Pros:- No more choking on milk- Prevents gas pain- Baby is comfortable and not fussy when eating- Easy to hold- Great for breastfeeding mamas who are pace feedingCons:- Gap large enough for baby's fingertips to slide into- A little difficult to clean with all the curvatures- Nipple sometimes gets clogged and needs to be squeezed in order to create a smooth flow again- Feedings take on average 17 minutes 
4, Good 
4, So many good things about this bottle but our favorite is the nipple because there is a valve that makes it anti colic without having too many parts to clean and then the nipple flow is slow and only comes out with suction for this set. So we loved it. 
4, The ultra slow flow nipple is perfect for my 6week old. With regular slow flow nipples he dribbled all over ate way too fast and then threw up. The ultra slow flow paces him nicely. Minus one star for the milk that gets stuck in the curve of the bottle just above the lid. 
4, So far so good...the only bottles my breastfed baby will take between breast feedinga. Nipple flow is slow enough too. 
4, This is a great product. Milk doesn’t leak and comes out slowly. Our baby able to latch on quickly. 
4, They’re good bottles- some times nothing comes out of them though (and no it’s not just a really slow flow.. literally nothing comes out until I mess with the nipple) they’re a little funny to hold just really small/compact. My baby seems to like them though! 
4, Be careful to check the numbers on the nipples! Our premie seemed to be almost choking on the “blue bottles” but did great with the white ones. We eventually realized that the white ones we had were a “0” which was extra slow flow and the blues were a “1” which was a slow flow. It took me forever to find a size 0 pack again because all of the FAQ are the same for every link of this brand (it says they are a size 1 in every description even if it’s not). For us the size 0 was the best fit for our premie. Then they have other numbers for faster flow and even ones best suited for cereal added into the bottle. The bottles themselves are great! They are a soft silicone nipple which “bends” in their mouth just like an actual nipple shape to fit their mouth. We love the bottles just be sure to check the size on the nipples :) 
4, I’ve been using the Nanobebe with premie nipples but wanted to try a BF friendly alternative that was a little easier to warm up/use for supplemental formula. The nipples on these is MUCH bigger and we have had leaks because the nipple pushes in and then comes out anti-colic vent. Overall just not impressed. :( 
4, My baby has no problem eating from these. The milk comes out at a nice speed not too much. 
4, Baby seems to have taken to this bottle better than the two other brands we tried. The extra slow flow nipple is great for my ten week old who was born two weeks early. Previous slow nipples still came out too fast and he would choke or spit up milk. 
4, I like that these bottles had #0 nipples already on them for our newborn but we have the common problem of the nipple collapsing in during feedings our baby doesn’t seem bothered but when we take them out of her mouth to fix a bunch of air bubbles collect in the bottle. I’m not sure if she’s drinking them or they’re leaving the bottle but overall good bottles and easy to clean with only 4 parts versus the Tommee tippee bottles with the temperature down stem. 
4," These bottles worked amazing for my nipple confused newborn. I have always been an avent bottle user for my other children. But my daughter who was strictly breast fed stopped taking from me after experiencing even the ""slowest flow"" nipple with avent. Still wanting her to breast feed but take bottles at night I had to research quickly bottles that would allow her to take both. After questioning a few reviews for tommie tippee I decided to give them a try. These have been such a great and inexpensive buy. My daughter within a day was back to breast feeding and still accepting bottles at night. "
4, FYI they come in extra slow flow nipples which was way too slow for my infant who is used to my oversupply. The nipples are not cheap either - typically 5.99 for two - so it was annoying to buy these plastic bottles that has nipples we can’t use and then to spend more money for the appropriate nipple. Wish these bottles were sold with other nipple flows. Additionally some of markings for volume have come off. Nonetheless they work great for my breastfed baby. 
4, I dislike the shape. Too much milk is still left in the bottle when tipped back upright. 
4, Love the bottle but you have to get the faster flow nipples. The slow nipple make the baby work to hard for the milk and my little one would just cry and cry. 
4, My baby is almost 2 months old and is EBF. I knew we needed a nipple with a very slow flow. Tommee Tippee was the only bottle that had the slowest flow nipple that wouldn’t cause her to choke.I did end up returning these bottles (closer to nature) b/c I find that the size “0” nipple has a faster flow than the size “0” nipple on the anti colic bottle. It’s more pieces to wash but is your looking for a VERY SLOW flow go with the tommee tippee anti colic bottles. 
4, One of the nipples we received didn’t have a hole for the milk to come out and we only realized after our son tried to drink from it for like 10 minutes and nothing came out. Luckily I contacted Tommee Tippee and their wonderful customer service department sent us new ones right away. 
4, The only reason why I had to give it a 4 star is that the bottle’s design makes it hard for it to empty all the way. I ended up having 1-1.5ml after each feeding even when i tipped the bottle all the way. Also the same when I transfer milk to a different container. It’s easy to clean and durable and great cost for what it is. 
4, I was so confused reading the Q&A and reviews b/c some said they came w size 1 but they came w size 0. I'm very glad b/c my 4 week old is drinking too fast and spitting up constantly. I have to pull the bottle out every couple minutes to keep him from over feeding. This is with any bottle I use not only these kind. I purchased the 3 pack which I was skeptical about since it's less $ than the 2 pack. Whyyyyy tho? Very strange. Thought they might be defective or old models. The box looked as if it could have been opened before but hard to know for sure b/c there was no sticker plastic or tape.I also purchased the Tommee Tippee Advanced Anti Colic w the valve & blue lids. I'm not sure I notice an EXTREME difference in the 2 but he does seem to be less gassy w/the Tomee Tippee bottles so far. I've only had them a couple of days and my other bottles are supposed to help this gas issue as well. I've been using both and I think the Advanced Anti Colic are a bit better but not a HUGE difference per say. They do require more attention and washing so if you don't have it in you I'd just get these rather than risk something growing in those tiny parts. 
4, Esta marca cumple con los requerimientos de calidad y uso para los bebés me gusta si tamaño práctico es un poco lenta la toma pero para bebés pequeños es recomendable. Adquirí esta marca cuando mi hija era un bebé ahora las compre para regalarlas a mi sobrino. Recomendables.————————————————————This brand meets the quality and use requirements for babies I like if practical size it is a bit slow taking but for small babies it is recommended. I acquired this brand when my daughter was a baby now I bought them to give them to my nephew. Recommended 
4, We were really happy with these bottles and excited to have less parts to clean but unfortunate 5 weeks in and our daughter began to colic cry. We switched to Dr. Browns which did help the gas. 
4, I bought these for my mostly breastfed baby as an alternative to Dr. Brown's and all their annoying parts. The slow flow nipple is really nice and so is the shape of the bottle. You just have to mind the valve thing inside the nipple because if it's not open the baby will suck and suck and not get any milk and you'll have a very angry baby on your hands! 
4, After trying about 6 other brands we finally found a bottle that my baby likes. We love the extra slow flow nipple for our newborn however I rate it 4 stars because after a week of use all the ink and fill levels began to wash off . We are using baby bottle soap nothing harsh so it was very disappointing to see it come off . It also left the ink speckled all over the bottle and transferred to the inside of the bottle while washing  Hope the ink is not harmful. 
4, Had to find a bottle for my little one as I am about to go back to work. We tried Avent and Dr. Browns with no success before turning to these bottles. My 2 mo. old took to them right away! The flow is great and she gets minimal gas afterwards. My only complaint is the way the bottle is designed you have to hold it completely upside down to get the last bit of milk into the nipple. 
4," My grandbaby was having difficulty drinking from slow-flow nipples and her mommy wanted to insure that she would continue to ""work"" on her suck so that she could continue to breastfeed. This bottle has an ULTRA-SLOW FLOW nipple that she is still using at 4 months. "
4, Is this the “miracle bottle” all the reviews say? Nope. However that being said this is the only bottle my daughter will even consider(by consider I mean attempt before crying as opposed to all tears and no trying at all) . I’ve had this for a few weeks and she is still being pretty stubborn about taking a bottle as she’s been exclusively breast fed but I will say that the small amount she’s taken it is much better than any other we have tried. 
4, I am extremely happy w tommee tippie bottles. My only complaint is that the nipples collapse at times during feeding. 
4, 5 oz bottles came with extra slow flow nipples which I prefer but the description said slow flow so I had ordered additional extra slow nipples that I now need to return. My first son preferred Dr Brown and Kiinde but second son prefers these. Currently 2 months and primarily breastfed but gets occasional bottles and will be getting more bottles once starts daycare. 
4, My little one had a habit of gulping down formula which resulted in spit-up or gas troubles. These bottles with the slow flow nipple (number zero) really slowed lo down and minimized colic. I love that I can count on it not spilling after the top has been screwed on (unlike other brands) and that it's shaped like a breast. I am completely satisfied with the purchase and would buy Tomnee Tippee Closer to Nature bottles again. 
4, Great product nipples are super slow flow. My soon to be 3 month old gets frustrated with the flow so we purchased additional nipples at increased flow. 
4, I’ve been using these bottles with my three month old son since he was 2 weeks old. He has terrible reflux and we have to be sure not to move him too much after a feeding to avoid spitting up. With these bottles he doesn’t seem to swallow any air at all so we don’t even have to lift him up to burp him. My only complaint is that the measurement markings on the outside have already started to wear off making it hard to accurately measure how much he is eating. I have been very careful with them and they have only been hand washed so they shouldn’t be unreadable already. 
4, Love these bottles..although watch for nipple flow. Each nipple has a number giving you flow baby gets. Pay attention when buying them. 
4, It's easy to clean …I like it ！ 
4, Bottles are great especially for breastfed babies the #0 nipple give a slow letdown very little gas the number one nipple they let down is too fast for my breastfed baby love the designer cute easy to wash out 
4, I really wanted my baby to love these. I use the dr. Brown bottles and they are such a pain to wash. She was able to latch on to it quick and easy with no problems the size is perfect and the bottle itself is so cute but this caused my baby sooo much gas. She was so fussy and couldn’t even fall asleep. With the Dr brown bottles she burps right away and falls back to sleep but with these bottles she wouldn’t burp so I would lay her down after 30 minutes of trying and she wouldnt fall asleep I would wait for a while get her back up and try burping her again and that’s when she would be able to burp. Went back to Dr. brown bottles and after a few bottles she was back to her normal self. 
4, Hard to clean but baby loves them 
4, These are well made bottles - easy to clean easy to hold. However my son just preferred the Lansinoh momma bottles so we didn't end up using them much! 
4, I like the bottle just fine but am not sure about the colic's because my baby suffers from colic's so much that I got some colic reliever medicine. I used this and the comotomo as well.My baby is 2 1/2 months and is able to hold it with some help.The nipples are good quality but the flow isn't even. I got 3 medium flow and seem like he was chocking with one of those . if your baby is a new born I would recommend to get the one with less flow then upgrade to medium.Good quality love to place them on the fridge with the lids. Quite hard to place it inside my baby bag because they are wide.In general I would say they are good but nothing so amazing just keep in mind they are wider than other brands. 
4, Just as described and fast shipping was very pleased with my order Thank You !!! 
4, Fairly good at keeping bubbles at bay but the hourglass design traps milk and formula up towards the top. To get the rest of it down to the nipple you have to take the bottle out of the babies mouth and shake the bottle. Avent and Dr. Browns turned out to be better options for our girl. Likely won't purchase again. 
5, Mama loves them. 
5, We tried multiple slow flow nipples and our baby was able to down a bottle in two minutes with all of them. We finally found these and he is able to eat a bottle over 20 minutes. He is so much happier and so are we! 
5, My grandson loves them and they are great at reducing the amount of air being swallowed. 
5, Gets the job done very slow floe to the point that my 1 mth old would get a little mad 
5, Haven't used these bottles before but they came just as pictured and I have no complaints. 
5, Love these bottles 
5, My 3month old loves these bottles. Easy to use easy to clean and no issues for my baby. Definitely worth the price and the try out if your looking for a new bottle. 
5, Great for breastfed baby who even at 6 months is still not great at controlling the flow from a bottle. This is the only bottle that he still uses when moms not around. 
5, Easy to clean easy to hold and suction is what it should be. It is a slow feed for babies who like to guzzle. Baby may seem like they are drinking a lot but they aren't. come out slow enough but baby will get enough. Also less air intake 
5, Our newborn came early and had been chocking on all other bottles we’ve tried this one works great. Very please 
5, Mine and my babies favorite bottles. He absolutely guzzles every other bottle in less than five minutes resulting in spit ups and lots of gas. This is the only bottle he doesn't chug; feeding takes 15-20 minutes and he feels so much better after. A lot less spit ups and less gas. 
5, Easy to clean perfect for nipple fed baby’s 
5, My baby is 4 months old now and still using it. I have been using this product since he was born and he is in love with it. This product really helped him to not suck in air . 
5, There was quite a bit of conflicting information in the questions and reviews. I can confirm that these bottles do come with the (#0) EXTRA SLOW nipple in case that’s what you were looking for like I was! 
5, Easy to clean not alot of pieces 
5, Very easy to clean and I like the overall shape 
5, Easy simple  least amount of parts .only wish it had some gripping lines sometimes it’s hard to open 
5, So I was a comotomo girl. I bought our son all comotomos and spent a fortune on them. Our son DOES use and like the comotomo bottles BUT we had a few issues with them that we just weren’t happy with. They yellowed really quickly and the ml/oz are extremely hard to see as they are clear as well. When you have to measure out what you are serving and what your baby is eating you don’t want the reading to be hard to see. I ran to the store and grabbed one of these bottles just to try. I loved the fact that it had a super slow flow for newborns and my son is preemie so the slow flows on the other bottles were making him gag and choke as well as made a huge mess. These are PERFECT!! Easy to read easy to heat the flow is perfect and our son loves them. I ordered these the next day and this is all we use now. 
5, Bought for a baby shower gift and the new mommy loves them. The grey is a light neutral color. 
5, I purchased these online because they weren't in store with slow flow nipples i love them 
5, Went through dozens of bottles looking for the right one... My daughter was in the NICU for 12 days with a feeding tube. We wanted a slow flow bottle because she would constantly choke since the flow was too fast on the Dr Brown slow flow nipples. Every brand of slow flow nipple we tried was too fast and she was getting too much milk at once. We even tried the premie slow flow nipples but they were too slow and she would get frustrated because she had to work too hard to get any milk. This was the only brand of bottles that was the perfect flow for her. She had no problems latching on. I’ve seen reviews were they say these leak but I’ve not had that problem. 
5, Christmas present for my grandbabie 😍 
5, Extra slow flow for eager bf baby. Love these the only bottle my son will take. 
5, I love these bottles for my 4 week old. 
5, It’s easy to clean and dry faster than other bottle. Sometimes will leak. 
5, A good buy 
5, The absolute perfect bottles. I used these bottles with my first and I’m using them again for my second. The ONLY colic/GERD bottles that actually WORK have very few parts clean up very easily have the perfect shaped nipple and NEVER leak.Tommee Tippee are the only bottles I’ll ever recommend or use for my own babies. My husband loved them as well for all the same reasons. You can store your baby’s milk in these with no worries at all.Ranting about other brands:You know what bottles leak? Dr. Browns. Man if I knew where Dr. Brown lived he’d have to pay for all the precious milk that leaked out all over our diaper bags. Plus the sheer amount of parts! He must be insane to think I want to clean 20 small objects a bottle.You know what bottles never clean well and always smell? Comotomo. The fad is a lie. I gave all the bottles away for free because I hated them so much that I felt bad asking a friend for money for them.In the end:Don’t struggle like I did with my first baby and just buy these right away. 
5, I liked the product for a newborn 
5, Best brand 
5, Perfect. I introduced this bottle to my son when he was about a month old. He took to it right away. Never needed to try another brand he likes this one! 
5, Perfect! 
5, My bby lovessss it! I love the slow feeding option. It puts him to sleep. It takes a lot longer to finish feeding but totally worth it. Less burps much more comfortable flow for him. 
5, I love the slow flow on these bottles. All the other brands we were using seemed to flow too fast for our newborn. These bottles are ridiculously easy to clean too which is important when you have a million other things to do as a parent. We have not experienced any leaks like we did with some other brands. Love these bottles! 
5, Affordable bottles that are close to natural breast shape and texture. My baby starts using it since the first day. We do both breastfeeding and bottle feeding. He is two month old now and hasn’t had nipple confusion. 
5, Works great for us 
5, Great for breastfed babies! They come with size 0 nipples. I also recommend buying the size 1 nipples in addition to these if you have a fast flow. 
5, I exclusively pump since my son was about a month old and these bottles are the only ones that he can't make himself sick with. All of our others (and there are many others) he drinks way to fast and cries when we remove the bottle to take pause. After a month of use there is a noticeable change as far as the amount he spits up and how long it take him to finish a bottle. 
5, Easy to hold soft nipple-has good flex lots of nipple replacementsTried advent and spectra bottles my little one did not take the bottle been nursing him for 2 months solely and wouldn't take the bottle easily. Finally found this one and he took it right away. 
5, Every bottle brand is going to be hit or miss with all babies. We have 3 babies and each one did better on a different brand. Our newest little guy is almost two months and these have worked amazingly. We did have him on the Dr. Brown’s Options+ bottles and they caused so much gas and spitting up. With our other two we had Phillips Avent and the nipple constantly collapsed on them. So far we have had zero issues with the Tommee Tippee bottles. The nipples don’t collapse and they’ve worked wonders on his gas issues. 
5, Easy to clean and comfortable 
5, This is really good for breast feeding babies. Especially if you’re trying to make it so that someone else can feed them when you aren’t around or resting. 
5, Perfect for my 4 month old 
5, I thought the flow would be too fast but it was perfect for my newborn. 
5, Who wants to keep brestfeeding your baby should to buy this one. They works together. 
5, My daughter has trouble drinking from another bottle because she has a strong suction and chokes while she drinks her bottle so I bought these to try them but they weren’t as slow flow as I thought they would be 
5, I tried a few different bottles to decrease colic and reflux prior to this purchase. However this was for the win! The nipple and rate of flow during feeding is perfect. I love this product. 
5, Just what I need to feed my newborn. 
5, These are my favorite bottles that I've used for all my breastfed babies! 
5, My youngest was very picky about the kind of bottle he would take. I was really stressed that I wasn’t going to be able to find a bottle that he would take and I would only be able to nurse him. We were working with a feeding specialist but it was actually a friend who suggested these. We had tried several (five exactly) different brands before we found these. He took it the first attempt without issue! I am so thankful!Otherwise the bottle is easy to clean and did not irritate his reflux. I highly recommend! 
5, Baby loved it. Slow flow. Less air getting into the stomach so it works good.
