1, Baby still doesn't take the bottle. 
1, Absolutely terrible the plastic nipple is so flimsy my 3 day old sucks so hard the opening is vacuum sealed shut and no milk comes out. She loses so much energy ducking for no reward she's so exhausted by the time I move the contents to a superior branded bottle.Seriously do not buy this brand product you and your little one will be left in tears of frustration! 
1, Bottles came used. Disgusting. 
1, This bottle is trash people saying nice things about this bottle I wonder why  they seem nice at first but after sterilizing they bottles they change shape and you can’t close them anymore 
1, I got these as a baby shower gift. I love the brand Nuk I used it with my two other little ones.But this time my baby would still act hungry and angry when I thought I was giving her two oz. I thought maybe little one just ate more. I use a formula pitcher to mix the formula then I just pour it into the bottle. I then realized that 2oz in this bottle was only 1oz in a different bottle. So I’ve been under feeding my baby and that’s why baby would act so angry and hungry after feedings. I switched bottles and now she sleeps better and looks satisfied. I hope this all makes sense.I like Nuk I don’t know if I just got bad bottles but they failed me this time around. 
1, Really slow flow took child forever to finish bottle 
1, I bought these for my newborn - he was using the ready use enfamil bottles the hospital provides for the first few days and was eating 2-4oz at a time. Then we ran out and started using the NUK bottles and almost immediately my baby got severe gas - spitting up gas diahhrea constantly fussy not hurting well and finally by day 3 he wouldn't even take the bottle and spit the nipple out immediately. I was a total wreck and sobbing bc he wouldn't eat. So we put two and two together and bought more of the ready use bottles he likes - turns out the NUK bottles nipples were WAY too big and allowed entirely too much airflow. We ended up ordering some Dr. Brown bottles with amazing reviews and similar size nipples to the ready use bottles. Every baby is different so this may work wonders for some but it was a nightmare for us and our infant. I promptly threw them in the garbage. 
1, The bottle is easy to hold for me however the font on the bottle is white against the white breastmilk while makes it hard to read. Most importantly the nipple that comes with this bottle is supposed to prevent babies from sucking up more air but it actually seems like my baby has been sucking MORE air which is causing her to have tummy pains due to so much air intake/gas. I have my newborn on the slow flow and she is constantly taking in so much air. Changing bottles now..... 
1, The scale on the bottle is all wrong. I have been giving my baby the wrong proportion of the formula. DO NOT BUY 
1, Poor plastic second bottle that broke because of the heat and second bottle with melted plastic. Will never buy again 
1, Mala invercion el orificio de aire no funciona al contrario tira la leche no recomendado para bebes menores de 1 año el chupon es muy pequeño y la succion del bebe no es correcta por la forma 
1, The bottles came back used and dirty. I will be returning them 
1, These bottles suck. They leak out of the air vent all over my daughters face and it goes up her nose almost every single time. Should have stuck to my usual Avent bottles. 
1, I bought it for My two month old No matter how much he sucked on the nipple he couldn’t get any milk.Avent from philips is better!!! 
1, Hate It. Doesn’t work. Milk Will Spill From All 3 Bottles. 
1, I wanted to love these bottles. Especially as a first time mom I did a lot of researchers before I finally purchased these bottles. Parents be aware that these bottles are TERRIBLE! AIR VALVE LEAKS INTO BABY NOSE OR NECK! DANGEROUS WHEN YOU ARE FEEDING BABY AT NIGHT YOU MAY NOT NOTICE THE BABY CLOTHES IS WET 
1, Very cute bottle and easy to clean. The nipples are the problem! They collapse every time the baby drinks which makes him frustrated. I wish I listened to other comments.. 
1, My daughter can’t drink out of these nipples... literally. They are so soft that keep collapsing when she tries to drink her milk and makes her so frustrated and fussy. A total bummer because these bottles have great reviews but unfortunately I’m returning them. 
1, I ordered to 2 packages of bottles and each package only had two bottles and which should of came with 3. 
1, Box completely destroyed 
1, Have to stop every 2 minutes to pull the nipple out of the bottle because they collapse inward. Horrible bottle I have five different bottles these are the only ones that don’t work. 
1, These are horrible! My child will suck on them and takes 25 minutes just to finish an ounce. I typically use honest company and he finishes 5 oz within 10 minutes. Wanted to try something new. 
1, The air vent on the nipple leaks horribly! I will not be purchasing any more ! 
1, Deformed after Sterelize on microwave.The other bottle completely melted and I threw away before take picture for this review. 
1, These are very nice looking bottles that we purchased for our newborn however; the nipple on the bottle literally overflows when she attempts to drink from it. Our baby would literally have milk spilling out after 5 seconds attempting to drink from them. We have the 4oz-11oz bottles and each one has the same issue (thinking maybe just one was defective). These would NOT be good for a newborn with colic or needs controlled output. 
1, It says the gift set includes 3 pacifiers one is 0-6 months two is 6-18 months. But I received 3 pacifiers that are 0-6 months. My son is 8 months old he can’t use any of the pacifiers. It doesn’t fit the description. 
1, The box was broken when I opened the package. I'm glad I didn't buy glass bottles or they would all be broken. This so unacceptable. The product its self it probably good. But I will review that when my baby is born. 
1, I wanted to love these. In fact I did love these until I realized how badly they melt. They did not last a week before one had to be thrown away. When steam sterilized one melted into an oval shape and the top would no longer fit. I didn't take pics of that one just tossed it and found a way to clean them with less heat (which was time consuming with a newborn). Then today the bottom melted while warming milk in the bottle warmer. The nipples on these are very innovative and my baby loved them. Unfortunately the bottles are trash because the actual bottle part is made so incredibly cheap! Wish I could get a 
1, The bottles were ok but my son doesn't not like them... hes unable to get good flow out of it. Very disappointed but they were a good price 
1, Very disappointed when I received my package. Missing one pacifier and every bottle had black scratches on them as if they have been used. 
2, Not easy to use the lid is easy to sink in not easy to suck! 
2, It is a great bottle as long as you don't drop them. They would fall off the counter at daycare and 3 bottles were broken so we had to switch. The thick tritan plastic easily shatters. I witnessed it firsthand at home. Other than that great bottle but not for daycare. 
2, These bottles are junk!!! We have owned 12 of these bottles and are now down to 3 in under a year. And don’t worry if one breaks the manufacturer won’t refund or replace their pathetically manufactured bottles. Made in Germany not China and that’s why they get 2 stars. 
2, We received one Nuk bottle as part of a variety pack and our baby loved it. I bought this set and have issues with the nipples. Only one of them has a vent that actually vents and it also lets milk out (when the bottle is still very full) right into baby’s nostrils. The other nipples do not vent and create a vacuum in the bottle until removed from baby’s mouth...defeating the purpose of the vent. I’ve tried “loosening” the vents but they still don’t cooperate. 
2, I was ordered all kind of bottle and my baby hates!!he took this one right away!!! But doesnt support falls 
2, I searched for glass bottles these popped up and i ordered... These are not glass bottles.. Very disappointing 
2, No me agrado que son de plastico 
2, My breastfed baby hated this nipple and the flow was too fast 
2, I really thought this bottle would be good because it is similar to the breast in shape but no matter which way you hold the bottle when feeding a bunch of air bubbles form in the nipple area during the end of feeding and causes her to basically suck air. This had potential to be really great but it's just not there yet. 
2, Not only did it take forever to get my bottles they arrived looking like they'd been opened and used. 
2, At first these are the only bottles my son would take I think because the nipple is a slower flow. However now he is taking 4 oz and my main issue is that you have to hold the bottle at an angle to make sure the milk isn’t covering the air hole at the top or nothing will come out. This is super inconvenient! Buying A different bottle set now. 
2, Breastfed baby does not like! Flows way too fast and chokes her. Also problems with nipple collapsing. A lactation consultant made a good point...don’t buy weird shaped bottled nipples unless you want your baby to cause your nipples to be that shape. Lesson learned! 
2, The bottles themselves are great. However Nuk decided to use a different size mouth than every other manufacturer which means you cannot fill them from most breast pumps (we have a spectra s2).Before you buy research bottle and pump compatibility. Some are the same others require an adapter. As far as I can tell there isn't a nuk/spectra adapter... 
2, Our baby wouldn’t take them 
2, These are not for newborns!! My baby was chocking because of how fast the flow was. They are also very cheap looking. Likely for the bottle to crack since is that hard shiny plastic. Do not recommend. 
2, I am not impressed with these at all! The nipple is constantly collapsing during feedings. Would not recommend! 
2, One drop to the ground and the bottle will break. We have officially broken every bottle. 
2, MIL ordered 9oz bottles for my soon to be 3 month old. I wanted to Love these bottles ! But they are no good. The nipple keeps inverting throughout feedings. Also the anti-colic vent shoots out milk. 
2, I initially received one of these bottles in a sample pack and found that my daughter did well with it and so I ordered this set. Unfortunately the very tiny holes in these nipples are really frustrating. First they clog pretty frequently causing frustration for baby. Second while trying to clean the nipple the holes actually tore. So now my slow flow nipple is a fast flow. I really liked these bottles initially but I would not buy again. When they work they're great but they don't hold up (I've had these a week) and they cause serious frustration. 
2, We have used and love the Nuk Simply Natural Baby Bottles. I recently ordered a pack of 3 it showed in the photo bottles that had Simply Natural written on them. When I received the bottles they say NUK on them not Simply Natural and these bottles are NOT what I expected or like. The nipples collapse very badly and baby has to stop 3 to 4 times while drinking a 7 oz bottle because of this. I don't know if I received knock off bottles or if the quality has gone down or just what has happened but definitely not happy this this purchase. Sent question to company but have not heard back. Did not return bottles as I had thrown away packing before realizing the quality of these bottles. 
3, My son is one month old and has used bottles since 3 days old. These bottles are not his friend yes he will use them however he ends up spilling/spitting out a decent amount of milk. My baby does way better with tommee tippee 
3, Sturdy bottle design. Easy to clean. Our kiddo had difficulties latching on since the nipple was shorter than other nipple designs. 
3, Baby did not like to drink from it. 
3, The quality is too thin I don’t think it’s as good as a physical store and the nipples are good 
3, They crack so easy. I’ve cracked 6 bottles from dropping them in the kitchen dropping them in the store the parking lot. I’m not sure if the design makes me drop them easily but they sure do crack once they hit the floor. 
3, We have not tried the bottles yet. The reason we purchased them is because our baby uses the Nuk pacifiers (size 6-18 mos) so we thought he would like the bottles too. I made sure to check the size listed in the description. It says it includes two pacifiers that size but they are a lot smaller than our other ones. I'm disappointed because I thought we were also getting some extra pacifiers. If I had known they were different than I would have just purchased the bottles for less money. 
3, I like this brand of baby bottles I never had any issues with this type of bottle but this this time happened the bottles had a big holes 
3, The top plastic is very thin and cheap. I had the 5 oz bottles of this brand and love how my baby easily drinks from the bottle. However I decided to upgrade and get the 9oz bottles. I am not pleased with the thin plastic nipple top. 
3, The flow is too much for my 4 month old baby although the nipple is the closest to a real breast it collapses and I have to constantly pull it out to take back to normal. I will say they are easy to clean. Maybe when my baby is older the flow won’t be too bad. 
3, looks not bad 
3, The bottles came with a ton of scratches and some of the stars where already fading off..I don’t want know how these look like after a couple of washes. 
3, My breastfed baby had a hard time getting the milk out of these bottles and she's used to preemie nipples with bottles for a slow flow but she would suck so hard it would collapse the nipple. Then the milk would drip out of the little hole on top which is there to help with colic. They would be great for some..just not my babe. 
3, Doesn’t help reduce colic gas and spit up at all 
3, I liked these before my baby started holding his own bottle. Now that he does the vent spills milk all over him. And now that he’s older he doesn’t need nighttime feedings but occasionally he’ll want me to just hand him a bottle and he’ll put himself back to sleep but again that’s not possible with these because the vent is basically a big hole that if he doesn’t hold it perfectly straight or if it’s upside down it makes a huge mess. Now I have to buy all new bottles since I had stocked my cabinets with only these kind when he was born. 
3, I’ve only had these for not even a month and it is already cracked. I never put through the dishwasher and always hand wash and it cracked while using it. Bummed since they are so new. But my baby loves them. Doesn’t drink too fast to cause throw up. 
3, I was looking for some new bottles for my little one and found that Nuk nipples are very similar to breastfeeding. I like the idea of the nipple design since it will disperse milk like breastfeeding! I decided to give it a try for the transformation since I’m weaning from direct feeding. However these bottles leak a bit for some reason there were two bottles in a package I thought it was just one that leaks so I tried the second one again but both of them leak. I lost patience and continuing to look for bottle that will help eventually... 
3, Looks great feels great....but after about 2 minutes of feeding the nipple completely caves in....every time. Very disappointed since I like the look of the bottle. 
3, As a first time mom I thought bottles are bottles. Not at all. Don’t get these for a new born. They’re better suited for a baby / toddler that knows how to feed themselves.This gave my baby crazy acid reflux. It wasn’t designed to where she can slowly feed as she needed too. This dropped at the nipple. Making her eat quicker than she was suppose too. So overall it made her throw everything back up. Giving me sleepless nights because I had to wait for the reflux to go away before I fed her again. Luckily. I bought a variety of other bottles. Avent is a life saver. 
3, Great milk bottle. Easy to hold and clean. If you intend to purchase this as a gift set at the last minute you might want to think twice. It was delivered with a bubbled packaging instead of a box. The product packaging was damaged. Decided to keep it for my own usage instead. 
3, Bought these for my baby useful but not wonderful. 
3, I got these bottles as I wanted to start off with a fresh set for my third baby and the older Nuk bottles worked great for my other children. He only gets a bottle at daycare so I cannot really judge suction and ease of holding. However there have been no issues with continuing feeding at the breast. Within the past couple weeks all three have cracked. So they only lasted 5 months. I still have the older model bottles but the newer nipple and ring are too wide. As he is 8 months old now I will be switching to the older bottles (that have lasted 1-2 babies) with replacement sippy cup nipples. 
3, Unfortunately my baby didn’t like these bottles but they are super cute and easy to clean 
3, Duraron casi 3 meses en el camino 
3, Everything works fine but the package was open. Everything was ripped open and sloppily thrown back inside. If I didn’t need these so bad I would have returned it. 
3, I bought these in hopes they would be the next best thing for my baby since she is going to be moving up to 6 ounces pretty soon. I get the whole breast like feel but the nipples were very flimsy and would push in when she would be sucking her milk. The clear bottle is esthetically pleasing to the eye but it the rest of the bottle (nipple and top) are very cheaply made. I’ll stick to avent natural bottles. 
3, Tried these as we currently use Dr Brown’s but I was growing tired of cleaning all those pieces. My MIL is the one that normally gives her a bottle and she is breast fed most of the time. The nipples on this bottle collapse frequently. Will go back to Dr Brown’s 
3, Good set. good value 
3, The 5 oz bottle is a good starter bottle for the baby. The bottle is a good shape and easy to handle during those late night feedings. Our grandbaby latched to them with no issues and they didn't make her breast sour when transitioning between the two. I like that they have a slow feed nipple that doesn't seem to overwhelm her. When she is ready we will definitely go with the larger bottle but this size is just right for now. The caps are a bit tight and can be a pain to remove and the design of the nipple being flat is a little cumbersome to clean but it is not impossible. There aren't a lot of parts to it so it isn't rocket science to take them apart and the bottle itself is a breeze to clean it is just the nipple that requires a little extra care and attention at the sink. The bottles we received had light colored markings on them that can be difficult to read when the bottle is full but really wasn't an issue to read as it is emptied. 
3, The nipple inverts while the baby is nursing. This is the first time this has occurred. This is the only brand we have used. 
3, First of all these bottles are huge which makes them difficult for babies who love to hold their bottles. They do however hold eight ounces and are easy to clean. The nipple which is designed to mimic breastfeeding is also super big. It has a really fast flow and my baby found herself choking on milk. 
4, Love that it dose not Leak like the other bottles ive tried 
4, Not my fav bottles.The nipple collapsed too easy when she sucked.We switched to a different bottle brand but won’t be throwing out since I’ll keep them for the next baby. 
4, My baby had a tongue tie revised and we are trying other bottles. This one did not work for us. He could latch and stuff but he ended up throwing it all up. 
4, For the price these are good bottles. Fairly easy to clean. The instructions only said do not microwave to avoid risk of burns and to sanitize with boiling water. So my guess is that they are not microwave safe. Usually I sanitize my bottles in the microwave and and heat the water on it too so I avoid to use these bottles if I am in a hurry.The other con is that the vent has to be facing up it makes it harder for night feedings and of course a baby would not know how to hold it properly. 
4, I love the bottle my baby was breast and bottle fed and with this bottle it was easy but now the lids won't stay on the bottle. 
4, Definitely will spill milk out the top little hole if you're not careful. For safety reasons your baby must sit up straight while drinking these bottles. Milk will go inside the baby's nose. The bottles are good though 
4, Bottles for girls are really cute. I like the wide mouth which makes it easy to clean. The only issue is that the slow flow has 3 holes compared to Philips slow flow which has only 1 hole. I feel like my newborn is drinking way too fast with these. 
4, I would give a 5 star review if the ounces weren’t written in white and more visible. That’s the only flaw. Very durable I would buy over and over. My baby is mostly breastfed and loves these bottles of momma isn't around . 
4, 2nd bottle we tried for baby. Not taking it but it is not pushing it neither I guess that's a good sign.Hopefully as baby starts solids baby will take this bottle it is very nice and feels right when holding on to it. 
4, Easy to clean and hold sturdy and anti colic. Nuk is the only bottles/pacifiers my newborn will take. The flow is good so my baby doesn’t become angry during feedings. If you have a hungry baby like I do just be careful because the nipple has collapsed while he was drinking and spilled on him when he was excited and drinking too fast. 
4, Came with fast flow nipples instead of size 1 slower flowing ones. 
4, My kid love them. Clear and easy to clean up. I bought nipple size 1 to fit with my 2 months baby 
4, These bottles are great! However be weary because these bottles caused my little one to no longer breastfeed. I have always bottle fed and breastfed with Avent bottles. I got these to add more bottles to the rotation and ever since she has refused to breast feed! 
4, Okay bottle. The air vent will leak tho so be careful. And be mindful of the direction the nipple goes in the baby's mouth.. it fits comfortably one way and one way only. 
4, The bottles are nice and easy to clean. They also have cute designs and my daughter prefers these nipples better than the Dr. Brown bottles. Only problem is the nipple collapses in for both my 5 month old and toddler. The airflow system might be too slow for my babies. 
4, Love how easy these are to take apart and clean. They have a good air flow through the nipple and no leaks. 
4, I tried 2 to 3 bottles with my baby but he really like this one. 
4, I havent used the bottles. I ended up returning them because I wanted pink. They are pale purple. 
4, We received two of these sets as gifts. We tried about six different kinds of bottles and these are by far our baby’s favorite. I know every baby is different but these for sure were the easiest for him to latch keep in his mouth and not get too many air bubbles. My only complaint is the air vent. It’s placed where baby’s chin is so sometimes he covers it up. And we’ve had to buy replacement nipples because a couple of them have gotten little tears in the air vent causing them to leak and make a big mess all over baby. (Not fun to discover at 3:00 in the morning!) But they’re still his favorite so I will buy replacement nipples anytime these get worn out. (I assume the tears are from washing them but I’m not sure.) 
4, Milk comes out a bit fast for my little one but otherwise a great bottle 
4, I've researched and tried several different bottles with my little. This bottle was the best for us. HOWEVER with these bottles its like the anti colic air vent is not working. EVERY TIME I have to stop feeding just to get the nipple back in place. I have loosened the top a little because I thought I screwed it on way too tight but that didn't fix the problem. The bottles I purchased in store work so much better.. 
4, I love the way they look such nice quality & doesn’t look like cheap plastic. The only thing I hate is that when baby is sucking the nipple gets caved in.. it’s honestly really frustrating:(Also the pacifier is awesome! It stays in his mouth better than the one he was using in the hospital. 
4, They are okay but the nipples tend to collapse. 
4, So far so good only has been a couple weeks. 
4, I loved these bottles I even just ordered a new pack of the NUK Simply Natural Baby Bottles 9 Oz 3 Pack. However one nipple came defective as baby drinks the nipple closes in all the way. Im not sure how to contact the seller about this problem. I am wondering if they can send me another nipple with my new purchase. I can return the defective one. 
4, Packaged Well. Good Price 
4, The low flow is perfect for newborn or premie. My baby was 3 months old when I got this set of bottle for him and the lowest flow was too slow for him. I use these Nuk bottles along with Avent and Lansinoh bottles. The Nuk nipples give him immediately comfort everytime he drinks it. I like to use these bottles for him around 3AM to 8AM (yeah my babies always sleep through the night) because it tends to not make him totally awake (because of the nipple shape and vent) so he falls back asleep quicker. However I don't like the shape of these bottles. They remind me of Tommy Teepe (a bit better) with the wide bottles feeling very not comfortable to hold. And the nipple with its extra special shape eventhough helps giving the baby's comfort but at the same time make me have to look which side goes top/bottom before putting it in his mouth which is very not convinience to use especially at night. Also the nipple is a bit more difficult to clean due to its shape. Anyway those cons are more for me though so if I have to give a recommendation about bottle for a mom between a few common brand baby bottles I'd still recommend Nuk for its overall features 
4, I originally liked the design of this bottle and nipple as it is similar to the Nuk pacifiers. After speaking with my lactation consultant however we decided upon another bottle similar to a mother’s nipple. This way we could transition from bottle to breast with less issues. We didn’t like that the base of the nipple was narrower. The bottles are very easy to clean though which I appreciate. 
4, This is a great bottle and I love it as well as my 4 month old but the only downside is that the nipple sometimes gets pushed in whenever my daughter sucks too hard. So far the writing has stayed in tacked. It is super light weight and easy to clean. 
4, Packaging is a little strange for me but the bottles are nice and have a good amount of holes for a more natural feel for your baby. Decent to clean I would just boil them at a low temp. Really good for new parents or if you just need replacements. 
4, it is kind to big for my new born baby. Maybe will be good after she turn one 
4, baby I watched had a hard time holding this. May be better for older babies. However the design is nice and smooth. I think it could have been just a tad wider for baby hands. Other than that love it was easy to clean 
4, These bottles are well made and designed to be easy to feed your baby. We have tried a TON of different bottle brands in an effort to find one my son liked. This one claimed to have a 96% acceptance rate—however my son is not in the 96%! Not the fault of the bottle however. Would recommend to a parent with a bottle accepting baby. 
4, Well I got the NUK Simply Natural Baby bottles for our new grandson. What I liked about the description was the natural look and style the bottle has. He was born early so these bigger bottles have not been used yet so My review right now is on what I am seeing and not used! I did wash these ahead of time for them and I am a little disappointed in one thing. You will notice in my pics that before I washed I had noticed a faint scratching all around the bottom half of the bottle. So I did wash thinking somehow it was there due to packing. However after such washings the scratches are still there. My dilemma is do I give baby bottles to a new momma with a few scratches? Of course the bottles are in good shape other wise and the important parts like the nipples are flawless. Note: They did wash real easy and dried without a lot of spots. I will let her decide what she wants to do about them! :) Well just had a problem loading photos will do so when able. 
4, I found this NUK baby bottle very good has nice suction bottle is sturdy and strong and helps with anti-colic. It does mimic a mother’s nipple so it definitely is a good way of transition for baby’s as the bottle nipple does resemble it. My only complaint would be the design of the bottle as it is hard for a baby to grab it with their small hands specially for those who are eating formula at a very small age. This works great for ages 3+ not very true for 0+. 
4, Having an exclusively breastfed baby made going back to work difficult. My son wouldn’t take a bottle until the Nuk! We tried at least 6 different types. Thank goodness for the Nuk nipples. The nipple holes mimic the way breast milk flows out slow to my son's liking.The rubber nipple is very soft and works great for breastfed babies. It has a secure seal when in place. They bottle is easy to take apart for cleaning as well. Fits perfect in my bottle warmer. The width however is still too wide for him to hold on his own but in a few months I'm sure he won't have a problem. 
4, Na 
4, I would say these are great for a breastfeeding momma as there are multiple holes for the flow of the milk. They are easy to clean. 
4, I really like these bottles. There is no fuss with these bottles. Now i have not had any fuss with other similar bottles as well. So it could just be the type of bottles being used. Either way they work great and i definitely would get them again. 
4, I got as a gift for a baby shower and the mother to be loved these. She states that they are helpful and easy to use and clean. 
4, The bottles are easy to take apart and put together. I find them easy to clean. The rubber nipple is very soft and pliable. It has a very secure seal when in place. I did a lot of moving the rubber part around with the bottle filled with water before using it. I'm sure I was rougher than a baby would be (minus biting - I did not put it in my mouth). Not one leak. Neither the plastic nor the rubber has a scent. A minor complaint is the plastic dome cap does not come off easily. I think that can be a good thing in many situations but it can be frustrating when it has to be done one-handed. 
4, This set has three plastic 9 oz. baby bottles for an easy transition from breast to bottle. The nipples are designed to be like the flow of mom’s milk and contains nine nipple holes. This natural feeding experience keeps the mom to baby bond strong. 
4, Good bottles and they feed easily. Shaoe is good for when baby can start holding own bottle. 
4, I honestly love this bottle. With that being said the only flaw is that they break easy. The first time was when it dropped Out the stroller onto the blacktop. The second time I was taking it out of the fridge and accidentally bumped it on The door. Both times it cracked. These are my favorite bottles it just Sucks I have to keep buying replacements. 
4, I purchased size 1 nipples. This bottle is very fast flowing. I have to give my 2 month old several breaks during his feeding. Not a huge deal since he will grow into it. Just beware. 
4, Lindas y prácticas 
4, I absolutely love these bottles! I love how thick the plastic is making them durable and sturdy. The nipple is extremely similar to the real deal and my daughter doesn't fight it. The color and design is really cute too! 
4, Don't put these through the dish washer. It makes them brittle and easy to break 
4, So far I haven’t had a problem with these bottles. The lid seals great so no leaky bottle which is why I’ve been trying to find another type of bottle. Easy to clean. Handles the dishwasher well. My son seems to spit up less after finishing the bottle. There is occasional formula leakage when he tries to get the hang of how to latch onto this type of nipple. Otherwise I’m liking them over Dr Brown bottles. Plus less pieces to wash. 
4, Let me say this the bottle is beautiful easy to clean..i gave it 4 stars because the nipple bends in wared when im feeding the baby no good!! 
5, Love these bottles !! 
5, My breastfed baby takes these bottles very easily with no nipple confusion. I used these for two babies since I loved them so much. 
5, This the only bottle my baby would take after being breast fed 
5, I got these because they had less pieces to manage than the dr browns. To be honest I don’t really notice a difference in a bottle with a vent insert and a bottle with a vent in the nipple. My baby has the same amount of burps with either bottle so since that’s the case I opted for easier cleaning. 
5, My 4 -month-old daughter seems to love them she was exclusively breast-fed until three months old and transferred over very easily with these and is trying to hold them all on her own and seems to not struggle to do so I feel like the shape makes it easy for her little hands to grip. 
5, I literally think I bought every kind of bottle out there and my breastfed baby didn't want any part of them. I wish I tried these first. He’s taken them for weeks now with no issues! 
5, No issues here! Reorder every few months 
5, Love these bottles. My two month old is breastfeed but I also pump and these bottles are a perfect transition. He goes back and forth no problem and it drops out naturally like your chest would. 
5, They came duty 
5, I love these bottles for my baby they are excellent only thing is the seal around the nipple ring can leak a little if you shake up the bottles 
5, I haven't bothered to try any other brand of bottles. I like the way these are they don't leak the flow of the nipples seems to be just right for my daughter & she uses them easily. I breast feed her so when others keep her & have to feed her there is no fight for the transition. They work so well in all aspects of their use I haven't bothered with trying anything else & I will continue to use these bottles. 
5, I bought soooooo many different bottles for my daughter. She was breast fed since she was born and when she went to daycare it took forever to get her to eat out of the bottle. After so many different purchases this was the winner! This is the ONLY BOTTLE she will take so I'm happy she is finally taking her bottle! Worth it! Saved me so many tears on my end trying to feed her! 
5, Great baby bottles. 
5, Easy to cleanGood color 
5, My 90% breast fed baby started rejecting bottles around month 3. We were feeding her one meal per day by bottle till this point using comotomos. She lost all interest and was stressing my husband and I out since I was going back to work shortly. We ordered 3 different bottles and were able to get her to take this one the easiest. Loved that the nipple is pretty slow and the flow does look similar to a breast. She isn't totally in love with bottles yet but this one has helped us tremendously with getting her going in the right direction. 
5, Love these! Received one set as a baby shower gift and switched from dr browns to these after a positive experience. No nipple confusion for my baby that is breast fed and supplementing with bottle formula feeding which was a concern for me. Cute designs easy to clean and they still look and smell good as new. 
5, the only bottles my son likes! truly the closest to a real nipple! 
5, I love how they look there's not a lot of parts which is great 
5, My first son nursed and took whatever bottle I gave him without a problem but baby number two was much pickier! We went through 6 or 7 bottles before we found this one and it’s the only one he will take without gagging or spitting out half of the milk! Great for breastfed babies and love that it doesn’t have a million parts to clean like some other bottles! 
5, Well worth the price. 
5, Perfect set has all three growth stages and the pacis were a great addition. Good quality easy to clean and use. 
5, Bought these to increase our inventory and I couldn’t beat the price for the number received. 
5, I’ve tried about 7 different bottles and this is the only one my breast fed baby will take. He also has no issues going back and forth between this bottle and breastfeeding. I love it! It’s also lightweight and easy to clean with very few pieces. I highly recommend giving it a try. 
5, My daughter loves them! I won’t use a different one again 
5, Nipple like! My infant really loves this bottle/Nipple. 
5, Super cute! We switched from Dr brown to these and my daughter likes them way more. 
5, Bought for a friend she used with her first child and she swears by them 
5, Gave as gift 
5, Amazing I had my son at 35 weeks and he wasn’t sucking well with regular nipples and was able to suck these nipples and feed perfectly fine from the bottle ! So glad I got these. 
5, Great baby shower gifts 
5, Easy to clean for me. They are incredibly heavy and well made. It’s a double edge sword as it makes them impossible for my baby to hold yet.I’ve dropped one from 4 ft off the ground onto a concrete driveway and it didn’t leave even a mark. The glass was fully intact. We absolutely will use only these kind of glass bottles. 
5, These are my son's favorite bottles. I love that they stay crystal clear after being washed multiple times. I've bought them multiple times and they are always great. 
5, These nipples are the closest I've found to a real breast and my newborn loves them! 
5, Great baby bottle! Reduced burps and spit up for my baby! Do not put in the dishwasher because the color of the nipples will change. 
5, Buen producto 
5, Love these! My baby is picky with bottles but latched on right away with these. He’s also breastfed so these are perfect. 
5, Perfect for our baby 
5, After trying so many different brands and being disappointed. dr brown bottles I could never get her formula to fully dissolve playtex leaked avent were great but super pricey. I got these and I love them. I have ordered 3 packs so far (had to replace one because I boiled them way to long) my fault. But I am totally obsessed and my daughter latches very simply. Great price too. 
5, These bottles definitely helped me to get my baby back to breastfeeding. I was using a different brand bottle when he first came home from the hospital and I learned quickly that nipple confusion is real!! These bottles are much easier to switch back and forth from nursing to bottle feeding and my little guy has been much more willing to switch. Definitely recommend! 
5, These are great for breastfed babies! My son wouldn’t take any other bottles. He loves these! 
5, Good gift for a new mother. 
5, The flow is very fast which is good for night feedings. During the day I use other bottles that have slower flow. Also the nipple is not round so its a little inconvenient that I have to find the right angle during the night feedings. 
5, Easy to hold 
5, I absolutely love these bottles! The nipple flow is great. Very cute color and design as well. 
5, Going from breastfeeding and transitioning to a bottle this was perfect. It's the best one so far. 
5, I really like the clean look the bottles shows. Bottles are really clear. Beak is wide enough for mess free pouring as well as for easy washing.The flow is extremely slow. I did make my own puncture on the bottle nipple. Works more than perfect. 
5, Love these bottles. However my little one has cracked maybe 6 out of 10 of these bottles. Definitely not drop proof. 
5, The plastic cleans up so easily and doesn’t get “filmy” over time like all of our other bottles have from another brand. I wish I had bought this Nuk bottle long ago. 
5, Very good option instead of breast feeding 
5, Perfect
