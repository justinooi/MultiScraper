1, Returning due to spout breaking as soon as opened 
1, This does not keep your drink cold for long at all. I would return if I still had the box. 
1, Flask did nothing you said it would. Water was room temperature in no time. Lid was on when I did the testing. 
1, I thought the cup was awesome worked great kept my ice water nice & cold didn't leak. But then after using it for a short time I noticed rust spots on the inside. And I could not get them to come off. I was able to return it & get another one but after using the second for less than a week I noticed spots on the inside of it as well. I decided to return it as well & just get my money back. I was very disappointed because other than the problem of it rusting I absolutely love it. Just wish it would have worked out. 
1, My friend had a hydra flax I liked it so I tried this version and was not very pleased what so ever in comparison. Please try harder 
1, I initially loved this bottle and thought it was so cute. I purchased the paracord handle and rubber boot for the bottom. Unfortunately it was dropped less than a foot height from my daughter and landed upright. The bottle exterior has cracked from a short fall with the protective boot on it. This has never happened before and I am disappointed to say the least. 
1, Didn‚Äôt keep liquids cold or hot for very long. It was pretty though. 
1, The flusk is made of low quality material. Rust became visible after a few times (photo attached) used and customer service came back telling us is a ‚Äústubborn spot‚Äù which is a very interesting way of rephrasing the word rust. 
1, the bottle makes the drink have a metallic taste and smell. i no longer want to drink from this bottle due to the health concerns. customer service is horrible and they will not follow their own policies. 
1, Dents very easily ruined the whole cup. 
1, It had dent on itü•¥ 
1, Ordered in October but gifted to my kids for Christmas. It‚Äôs now February and my oldest daughter can‚Äôt use her cup anymore. It fell off her school desk onto a carpeted floor and the lid shifted to a point where it no longer opens. My husband has tried everything to open it and nothing will work. Going to have to toss it at this point. Daughter has no cup for school now. 
1, Love the straw feature easy to drink from and super cute 
1, Cannot retain heat 
1, This doesn't hold the heat or cold for more than a couple of hours. Disappointing 
1, Arrived damaged on the outside which was very annoying but I was willing to live with it the next morning when I put the straw lid on it rip. I contacted the vendor for a lid replacement going back and forth with email provided proof and never heard from them. I was really looking forward to using my water bottle too bad vendor doesn‚Äôt stand by their products. 
1, This does not keep my water cold at all... I have a hydro flask and although it is significantly heavier... I prefer it because it keeps my water cold for days.... I‚ÄômNot sure if I just got a defective one or not but... I have been trying to give it a chance but it is not insulated at all.. very disappointed! 
1, I got this water bottle and love all the lids it came with and the color. Today I filled it up more than half way with ice and it already melted in a matter of 5 hours and the water bottle was kept in cool temperature. Never buying again waste of money. 
1, After 2 months of use I noticed an orange residue on the bottom of the bottle. After close inspection with a flashlight I found rust has formed in the seam where the bottom and the body of the bottle are connected.I contacted the seller who immediately gave me a refund but who also forgot to mention it will not include the shipping cost and will be the price of the bottle on that day and not what it was on the day I purchased it.I found out the exact amount only after I received the refund (My bad for thinking it goes without saying the refund should be on the whole amount paid).So...in conclusion. Bad product. Good customer service who turned out to be a bad one. 
1, I received my bottle today and noticed that there were some scratches on the sides. I was going to let it go until I opened lid and noticed there was LIPSTICK on it and saw the bottle was used. So it had scratches dents and was used. I returned and I'm not even sure if I will order another one. Ugh. 
1, nothing I liked aboutit . ice lasted about 12 hrs. I HAVE A BETER PRODUCT FOR HALF PRICE 
1, Within a month this water bottle somehow started showing condensation on the outside. I wanted to exchange it but I don‚Äôt have an option to. 
1, Definitely would not recommend buying iron flask. I wash and scrubbed with a bottle scrubber every few days. I literally just wash it 2 days ago and it was clean. Today I open to refill and I noticed black fuzzy spots at the very bottom edges! All I drink in this is filtered water. My hydro flask has never done this. Definitely don‚Äôt recommend buying this. Spend a little more for the hydro flask! 
1, Starting to rust :( 
1, I will change my stars as soon as i get a replacement lid. I purchased several of these for my grandsons and several have defective lids but my window of return has expired. Love everything about them but the lid. When i get my lid replacement lids you will get my 5 star review. 
1, I started the return process within 10 minutes of opening the box. The stated description is vacuum insulated stainless steel & double walled. The only thing correct is that it is stainless steel. If you are looking for a cheaply made drink container this is for you. 
1, When you try to close the cap tightly it loosens up and you end up with an open bottle again 
1, The item was damaged not impressed! 
1, Very disappointed cuz I bought this and paid good money for it cuz our old water bottle leaked but sad to say this expensive one leaks too 
1, Absolutely contains PBA after using this buttle for a month My sex drive decreased badly 
1, This thing leaks everywhere 
1, This is my second one in a year. It was one thing that my first one fell off of my child‚Äôs wagon onto the ground and the handle broke but earlier today my new one that I received in November fell off of a coffee table onto carpeting and the spout hit the end table breaking off. Incredibly disappointing. 
1, Leaks constantly. Trash product 
1, leaks and horrible customer service 
1, The bottle started leaking after 2 months of use. 
1, I bought three bottle and I really regret it! I saw the reviews on how well the bottle held up and I loved the colors and figured that the price was a great indicator about the quality so I bought one. It was to big but that was my mistake so I bought another for myself and one for my daughter without trying the first one. This was a bigger mistake. This bottle no matter what lid I use can't keep my drink cold more than 2 hours. At this point I would be better off with an $8 one from the grocery store. Will not be buying anymore save your money. 
1, See the attached photo 
1, i contacted customer service and they didn‚Äôt really help. even though they have a 100% satisfaction guarantee. 
1, However this only hold approx 37 oz at the most. The straw lid worked great for 5 weeks then we were sucking in more air then water =(. The clear plastic is loose and no longer holding the straw in. Not happy at all as this was a huge part of buying it.New lids are needed not the straw part.Nearly $55 for 2 bottles to last 5 weeks very unhappy. One of the first 2 bottles arrived dented on bottom and Amazon replaced it.UPDATE: I ordered the replacement straws same thing happened. All broke apart.... 
1, I bought this item for specific reason that it wont leak and will keep my water cool or hot but it doesn't !!! Whatever the seller describes the bottle does its fraud. Will request for refund after all. 
1, I had my hopes up.. but the Iron Flask was really disappointing. I didn‚Äôt receive my order complete - check the picture. 
1, two of the caps (the one with the straw and the one with an opening that snaps on and off) leak water. There is too much friction with the solid cap. I ended up getting flakes and bits of plastic in my water from opening and closing the cap making the flask unusable. Combine the friction with the smooth cap with no handles it's more difficult to open the flask with the solid cap compared to other brands where the solid cap has a handle. The tether from the solid cap to the bottle makes it more difficult to screw/unscrew the cap. Don't know why this has such a high rating. 
1, I paid extra to get the 40ounces. I went out with it once and thought it was way too small to be 40ounces so I put it to the test. This can hold 30ounces of liquid. Total scam. 
1, So I ordered the super cute bottle Pink with blue. I washed it(super easy) I used it for the first time. I added Ice and it melted right away. I noticed it would leak (checked to make sure everything was secure) the leak is not always but it has leaked 4 to 5 times within the last couple of months. I dropped it 1 time and now there is 2 huge dents on the bottle. The paint started to chip off. For me it was a complete waste of money. Not sure If I can still return it but I figured this was just a complete loss for me. The good was cute color options hold a lot of water (less trips to fill) and also has a clip to clip on your backpack and its easy to drink and clean. 
1, I bought one a while back and I loved it so much so I thought about getting a smaller one for work. When you try to drink out of the straw lid the water wouldn‚Äôt come out. 
1, To big! 64oz is enormous 
1, The box looked open several times :/ 
1, Wow. Just opened it up and the straw literally was in 2 pieces. Like how did this even happen 
1, Absolutely worst kind of quality. Totally disappointed. 
1, The straw lid sprays water like a geyser at you when you open it. Sent video to customer service they sent a new lid only. Not a new bottle and not a refund. Disappointed by the product and service was wish I had bought thermoflask insteadUPDATE: replacement straw lid still squirts water üí¶ when it is opened 
2, Very cute water bottle but water does not stay cold for 24 hours. My marker for a good water bottle is if I fill it up at night with cold water and ice before bed and it‚Äôs still cold in the morning. This bottle does not do that. Would not purchase again. 
2, This water bottle was great until the straw quit working. My 6 year old son used this multiple times a week but not everyday. I expected for the price the straw should work for longer than 6 months. 
2, Ok so I actually purchased three of these bottles at three different times (two were gifts for family members). I bought myself one first back in maybe March of last year. I initially loved this water bottle. The design is nice and sleek. The bottle does an excellent job at keeping the water cold for the anticipated amount of time. The bottle came with two different lids and a cleaning brush which makes cleaning the bottle and the straw super easy. Here‚Äôs the problem. After using my bottle religiously for over 6/7 months it began to leak. Seems like the rubber park underneath the lid doesn‚Äôt fit as securely as it did in the beginning so now if the bottle is on its side it leaks for sure. I spoke to both gals I gifted this bottle to and after months of using theirs theirs leak also. So yeah. FYI. This bottle will leak. People probably don‚Äôt say that in their reviews but that‚Äôs because they are reviewing the bottle after only a few weeks of use. Remember I loved this bottle in the beginning too. Hope this helps. 
2, Got this product because of the straw attachment and it doesn‚Äôt even work. Very disappointed. 
2, Package came damaged & seal broken. Seemed like a returned item not happy with that especially at this price. 
2, Ice melts quickly doesn‚Äôt stay cold. 
2, This bottle does not keep my water cold at all. I've had my swell bottle for 5 years and it works amazing you can leave ice in it overnight and it won't completely melt. I purchased this bottle because they are cute and have a wider mouth to add ice. With this bottle however my ice is melted within a few hours. I'm not sure if its defective but I doubt it because I purchased two of them and they both do not keep water cold. They are pretty but I won't continue using them so it was a waste of money for me. 
2, Only down side less than a month in and it already has a rust spot inside. 
2, It is easy to clean the accessories are great it doesnt leak easy to drink from. HOWEVER the bottle itself doesnt not keep my ice cold and it builds condensation on the outside of it. Thats the only reason i am giving it a low score. 
2, While this bottle is lightweight and fairly easy to drink from it does not maintain temperature as well as it should. I have other significantly less expensive bottles that maintain actual ice as well as cold beverages for 24 hours. Next time I need a new water bottle I will purchase a different brand. 
2, Water leaks after two months of use. 
2, Bad seal and leaks alot 
2, The water bottle looks like it would be great but it arrived dented. Hopefully I will be able to update this review with more stars once they replace it. 
2, My ice melted in less than an hour. Definitely not comparable to other name brands. 
2, The product became cold to the touch after filling it with cold water. The water inside after a couple of hours had warmed noticably. I did a hot water test and noticed I could feel where the water level was through the walls. The is also heat loss through two of the lids I tried. 
2, Ridiculous that stainless steel straws don‚Äôt fit either the opening of the lid or the length of the bottle. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the first that doesn‚Äôt want to drink hot beverages through plastic. Was looking to replace my whole travel mug cabinet with these but the lids are such an oversight guess not. Like so many things: Disappointing but pretty. 
2, Pretty color. Doesn‚Äôt keep ice frozen for long. The top leaks in any position you place it in. Once the water inside of it gets down to a certain level the straw won‚Äôt reach the water that‚Äôs left inside of it. Not a fan. May work for some people. I work ems i need to have water all day long. Kinda hard to do that when the water doesn‚Äôt stay cold and it leaks every chance it gets. 
2, Water bottle came with a dent in it and so I would like a discount but there is not that option but only to return it. 
2, Keeps cold water actually *cold* for about 3 hours and then after that it quickly rises to room temperature. If you put cold water in it the bottle is literally cold to the touch instantly ‚Äî it does not insulate well at all. Don‚Äôt buy this when other options are similar/cheaper in price and will actually keep water cold. 
2, Tested it the first night I received it by leaving hot water in the bottle for 10 hours overnight. In the morning the water was nearly room temperature and not even lukewarm. Disappointing performance for a bottle that is supposed to keep liquid hot for 12 hours. 
2, Beautiful bottle. Cool idea with multiple lids. But the straw doesn't work. It is like drinking through a straw with holes in it. Quite frustrating. 
2," Pros:*Sleek looks nice*Multiple lid attachments*Two straws*Stainless steel*40oz profile is perfect; very happy they went ""up"" and not ""out"" for cupholders.Cons:*Mine leaked with the straw lid and the sip lid. Cover cap worked fine.*Flip top on the straw lid does not seem seated properly... wiggle side to side quite easily and leaks.*Not sure how to clean the straw of this thing. I'm sure you could get away with rinsing/washing but I would prefer some kind of pipe cleaner that scrubbed it*Finish chips quite easily*Insulation is ""OK"" (Compared to RTIC brand) "
2, When I opened the waterbottle it was wet inside and was clearly used... this was alarming due to COVID-19. The item description stated possible damage not previous use. I marked it as 1 star for easy to drink from because I will not drink from it until I've cleaned it well and was required to rate this 
2, The lid has been bewitched and prevents me from opening it once in 3 or 4 times. Not much you say. But when you're late and just need to pour your hot tea in the thermos so you can get out the door... A stuck thermos is the last thing you need. At this point I've just given up. It sits on my counter no doubt growing all sorts of icky things inside because I cannot open it. It's a very pretty color though. 
2, Bought a new one cause my first one started falling apart in more ways than one but it kept my water cold for a LONG time. I could put ice in it and the ice would stay frozen overnight in my room and I'd have some nice cold water to drink in the morning. The new bottle clearly isn't insulated as there's only lukewarm water in it in the morning. And it's been this way two nights in a row now(I thought maybe I didn't have enough ice in it) Will not be buying this brand again. 
2, Its a very nice product and works very well except for two things. The bottom came a little dinged. So I had to buy a rub cup to hide it and the clip on the carrying handle was broken. 
2, This did not come complete with the lids the description has listed 
2, What I liked? The fact that it keeps my beverages cold.What I disliked:It‚Äôs extremely uncomfortable to drink from the straw lid. I was used to the soft rubber-like lid that HydraPeak offers and I though this would be the same. But no. Sadly no.Also the sipping angle of the straw is uncomfortable.I know I may not be able to return the product because of Covid and all. But I am not at all satisfied with me purchase. 
2," O.K. I got this and one of the caps kept breaking. Just from normal use the plastic cracked. But..they replaced them. THEN the bottle had something rattling in between the layers. I asked ""maybe I have a defective bottlewhich is why the lids cracked?"" They replaced the whole thing no questions asked. I have my 2nd bottle. THE LID RANDOMLY CRACKED AGAIN..now they wont reply to my emails asking for a replacement. I get it but its not me its got to be the plastic in the sip lids they use. "
2, It was a great water bottle at first but eventually the straw wouldn't stay on inside the bottle and constantly came off. I stopped using it. Waste of my money. 
2, At first I was happy with the product but now that I done had the product for a while I see the flaws first off I dropped my container once now everyone I put it up to drink I hear this ringing sound just because I dropped the container 1 time secondly whenever I get coffe I put ice in it and when I shake it to get the coffee to get a little cold coffe spills out the container that is so Annoying if I had to say anything good about Thai product it would be that it has a 3 different options of how to drink 
2, Great bottle and does it function well. Just a bit bleak they sent me the 40 ounce when I ordered the 64 ounce 
2, I was super stoked to get this and watched a YouTube I follow promoting your company. I was disappointed when it didn‚Äôt even hold my ice for four hours. It melted quick. I‚Äôm sure I will not be using this product again! 
2, All other reviews claimed it keeps ice overnight which was one of the reasons I bought it. But the reality is that it does not insulate and keep water cold beyond 5-6 hours. Even when filling it up to the top with ice everything is melted and warm after about 6 hours. The Contigo brand keeps your drink cold for longer so I will go back to that brand. 
2, It came dented! üò¢ 
2, First of all the water bottle looks great. It‚Äôs a very nice finish and doesn‚Äôt scratch easily. I love that it comes with several lids and the ‚Äústraw‚Äù lid works great.I have two issues. One is that this does not keep water cold even for 8 hours overnight in a 68 degree house. When I get up in the morning it‚Äôs room temperature. I haven‚Äôt tested the heat retention much yet.My second problem is the ‚Äúhot‚Äù lid leaked and made a mess on my cars floorboard. When I look at the lid it appears there is a space for an o-ring but no print is present.I emailed customer support and asked for a replacement lid or o-ring. They emailed back and request a video of the bottle leaking. I think it‚Äôs absurd that they want me to make another mess before replacing a part that can‚Äôt cost more than 10 cents.I destroyed the packaging so I can‚Äôt return it but I won‚Äôt purchase another product from Iron Flask. 
2, I loved the color and the thickness when i first saw it but then noticed a dent on the bottle I had gotten the warranty and tried to reach out to the company  but was never responded too I am dissapointed in the customer service ... If I had been reached out too regarding the issue I wouldve loved the product . 
2, NOT dishwasher safe! LAME - would not buy again :( 
2, Worked great at first but then the flip top straw started to leak. 
2, This bottle is great pretty and doesn't leak but it doesn't keep beverages cold like a thermoflask. My thermoflask can still have ice cubes in it 12 hours later (the longest I ever tested it) but with this bottle the ice is melted within 4 hours. I won't be buying again and do not recommend this product. 
2, The bottle looks to be of nice quality however the straw lid (which is the only one i use) leaks if the bottle is on its side. I contacted customer service and they asked for pictures/videos. I sent both atleast 3 times through amazon messages and they kept saying they didn't get it.... fourth time was the charm and they finally received the pictures. I honestly call BS on this it seemed like they wanted to make it difficult on my behalf so they wouldn't have to give me a new lid or refund etc etc. They eventually sent me another straw lid WHICH STILL LEAKS. At this point i think it may be the bottle leaking and not the lid however i'm not going to waste my time contacting this company again.TL;DR: LID LEAKS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NOT GOOD. 
2, Convenient bottle. Nice look. Doesn't really keep water cold for more than an hour. I usually put ice in it to keep it cooler longer. Had cheaper bottles keep things cold for longer but was worth a try. 
2, Super sad- Missing the straw cap which is the entire reason I got this. 
2, Normally love this product (bought two before but lost them unfortunately) but this time I didn‚Äôt get the lid with the screw top opening. Very disappointed as this is one of the reasons I liked the bottle in the first place. 
2, It does not keep my water cold ice melted within an hour 
2, Cute colors don‚Äôt make up for the fact that it does not keep drinks cold. 
2, lid leaked and spilled all over. didn't keep the ice cold that long 
2, Ice melts in just an hour. Very disappointed for spending $25 
2, Came with a dent at the bottom not too happy with it 
2," I had to stop using this water bottle because it leaks a lot. You really have to ""snap"" the top in place to get it to not leak and I found it really frustrating to drink from I no longer use this water bottle. Wouldn't recommend. "
3, Ice melts at room temp after 4 hours. 
3, I really liked the style and appearance. However the hot drink lid is not leakproof and made a mess in my bag. 
3," First time I've ever written a review (/._.)/1st. I work at amazon and have done packing before this came along with 2 other smaller items and came in a ""Bag"" instead of a box because the Iron Flask didn't come in its own box so it had little scrapes this whole order should've been put in a box with dunnage.2nd: Every where on the Iron Flask Description said it came with 3 lids. It only came with 1 \(-.-\)Still a good flask. Maybe I got unlucky. Oh well. Shouldve came with 3 lids and it's own packing. "
3," We have three of these water bottles and have different experiences with all three. One is perfect and I would rate 5 stars with keeping drinks cold and not leaking and maintaining all function. One had a broken lid within a month of use (good thing it came with multiple lids!) and one had chipped paint within a month of use. Just note that the lifetime warranty covers ""manufacturing defects such as leakage insulation or rattling noise"" but not our issues! Drinks are still cold and not leaking but I was hoping for better overall quality at this price point. "
3, I PURCHASED THE 32 OZ FLASK ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO FOR 24.00 AND IT WOULD STAY COLD WITH ICE FOR ABOUT A DAY. NOW THE OUTSIDE IS COOL AND THE INSIDE IS WARM. PLEASE CONTACT ME REGARDING THIS ITEM. I WAS VERY HSPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT AND NOW I HAVE TO PURCHASE ANOTHER FLASK. MY EMAIL IS WILHEMEIA.SEWARD@YAHOO.COM. 
3, The lid popped out after the second use it‚Äôs not safe to use without the fear of spilling water all over the place. 
3, I LOVE this water bottle. It‚Äôs easy to clean easy to carry and the color is absolutely stunning. I have used it literally every single day since receiving it. I‚Äôd easily give it five stars for all of that except for the fact that it dented after about a month. I dropped it about 1 foot from the ground onto the pavement. I don‚Äôt even know how it could dent like that the way it was dropped. I continue to use it but after how much I spent on it the fact that it dented after one small drop is a little disappointing. 
3, Okay so I bought my Iron Flask in October of 2020 we are now in March 2021 and I feel like I should say something now that I‚Äôve had it for a while. When I first bought it I thought it was amazing! I could add ice to it and the ice would still be there two days later however now it doesn‚Äôt stay cold like how it used too. If I add ice to my flask now I‚Äôm lucky if it hasn‚Äôt all melted within four hours. But even with ought ice I‚Äôve noticed that my water just doesn‚Äôt stay cool like it used too. Its a really good and cool product at the beginning but the quality does go down with time. I‚Äôm pretty sad it‚Äôs not working like it used too and I‚Äôm actually really considering getting a hydro flask now. 
3, The full seal cap is leaking unless I tighten it as hard as I can and the small cap on the top that covers the swivel mechanism fell off in the 1st few days. The bottle looks great and seems solid but some of the parts I got with it are mehhh. 
3, The build of the flask is really good the coating they use for the color seems like it's built to last. There's 3 different tops that come with which is neat it also come with two straws for the ummm suckable top. I guess my only complaint is it doesn't really keep things cold long. I've tried cold water plus ice and mostly ice and water and in a couple of hours it'll all have melted and my drink will have considerably warmed. Annoying but for the price I paid I suppose it's okay. Neat product. 
3, The water bottle is really nice however a huge downside is whenever you drop it it dents and scratches really easily. I have only had it 2 months and I will need to buy another water bottle very soon because It dents and scratches super easy 
3, At first I loved this bottle but over some use (a month maybe) the straw has started to become disconnected before each drink. This means I have to unscrew the lid every time adjust the straw screw the lid back on. I think the silicone seal is coming unattached. I have not been rough with this bottle nor cleaned it other than wiping the lid down. I'm disappointed because it was such a wonderful product at first. I hope mine is just a defect. 
3, My issue is it does not keep cold as advertised I put same size ice cube in this one and my other one I own and My large bottle ice cube melted in less than an hour where as my cube in my other bottle was still fully frozen 
3, Great bottle and durable! 
3, The regular stainless steel lid with the loop that attaches to the bottle and the top of the lid broke... Now I use the straw lid... I don't care for it at all. I like the bottle but fix the durability. For what I paid that is just wack. Bottle 5stars. Lids 2stars. 
3, I love the bottle it's so pretty easy to drink but it leaks and thats so disappointing 
3, It doesn't keep cold. My ice will be melted in 8 hours or less. My cheap water bottle would keep my ice for 24 hours. 
3, I don't know about others but mine sweats other than that it works well as just a water bottle. It doesn't hold cold that well and ice causes it to sweat. But other than the sweat and not holding cold well its great if you don't like cold water and don't care about a sweaty bottle then this is the bottle for you. the carrying attachment is highly recommended if you do buy the bottle tho makes it even easier to carry. 
3, I bought this because I needed a good summer water bottle. The reviews and price made me decied to buy it. I didn't notice that it kept my water and ice colder than the cheap water bottle I bought at a big box store. I don't think it was worth the extra money. 
3, It‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful product and I love the lids/colors but it does NOT keep stuff cold 24 hours!!! Not even for 6 hours (with half ice)!I haven‚Äôt tried using it with hot stuff yet... but I‚Äôm doubtful. Great look but mediocre function. A cheap similar product alternative at your local market chain with outperform this one in terms of insulation! Buyer beware. 
3, The bottle is great! However i do have a problem with the lid of this bottle. The nozzle that i sip from is scew and due to that the lid leaks where i drink water from. 
3, I like the design size and colors. However compared to other similar bottles I have it doesn't compare to keeping things cold it's a real disappointment in that dept. If you don't mind it not keeping the temperature it's a great bottle. 
3, Purchased to replace a brand name bottle that got damaged. Loved the color and assumed they are all the same. Not so...At first I thought I was being unreasonable and that it was the same as my previous bottle. Then I was in a few situations identical to previous situations and discovered that the ice melted faster and the drink didn't stay cold as long. Unfortunately have returned the bottle and replaced it with the name brand bottle. It is noticeable how much colder it stays for longer. 
3, Love the colour and look of the bottle. It does not keep ice or drinks cold. Cup is not insulated. 
3, Let me just start with I really love this brand and there water bottles. But I purchased one of the 64oz. Water bottles about 4 months ago and it has been a series of problems. 1. My straw kept slipping out of the top and eventually I just took it out and just tipped the bottle up to drink. 2. For some reason water continuously leaked out of the mouth price even when closed. 3. The straw doesn‚Äôt reach to the bottom of the bottle so I always have to take the top off to get the last cup or so. 4. I just went to wash my bottle (never dish-washed always hand washed) and as I was untwisting the top part of it just came off in my hands just crumbled off. I‚Äôm highly disappointed with my recent purchase with them I want to buy a replacement bottle but am worried it will continue with problems and may just have to switch to a new brand. Very sad ( also note my bottle was dropped from little and hasn‚Äôt been dropped anytime recently before I went to wash it) 
3, Nice options with lids but be warned the straw makes a really annoying squeaking sound every time you drink from it. Adjusting the lid and straw seems to have no effect. 
3, Good water bottle but if you are looking for a bottle that stays cold this isn't it. Ice melts within an hour and it's room temperature within another hour. Only stays cold if you drink it fast while it's still cold but it is pretty. I bought it in marble. 
3, Does not keep the dring cool for the day 
3, Perfect for about 9 months now the cap with the straw no longer lines up correctly when fully opened so when you drink it's mostly air. Easy to correct but annoying. 
3, I like the cup overall as I already have a few of them. I decided to try the imperfect 2nd chance to save a few bucks (New Years resolution). I would highly not recommend that option. Amazon does not properly vet the returned product. Mine was packaged wet from previous owner which allows for an odor to develop. Plus who does that!!! Anyway...I cloroxed and then ran through the sanitizer function through my dishwasher. It is now airing out. If smell is still there I will return. 
3, This is a good bottle it seems sturdy and I'm excited to use it every day. However when I got it out of the box the screw cap was damaged. 
3, Cute bottle but has a strong mildew smell the second I opened the box 
3, Beautiful bottle. Love how much water can fit and the color is gorgeous.One big design flaw however. I‚Äôm noticing that it‚Äôs sweating a lot through the bottle. I‚Äôve had mine a few months and it‚Äôs only a recent issue. I was careful to never wash it in a machine or to leave it in the sun too long so I‚Äôm not sure why this is happening. I‚Äôll see if there‚Äôs a sleeve that I can put around it to avoid the issue damaging any tabletops or leather car seats. Other than that it‚Äôs an excellent product. 
3, Did not come with straw lid as advertised which was one of the main reasons we purchased this. 
3, Doesn't work quite as well as our hydroflask but does the job. The color though was much different than the picture. 
3, I got this as a gift but it came damaged with a very noticeable dent in the bottom which also basically chipped away the paint. It comes with three different tops to choose as your drinking method as well as an extra straw; however there are different bottles with way better options. Two of the tops are terribly impractical cleaning wise the third is just a huge opening which I personally would never use.Overall maybe they have cool color options but it‚Äôs not very practical if you prefer not to drink leftover bacteria particles and mold from their tops and their durability is terrible save your money and get another brand. 
3, So I bought this on a whim. Typical moi. Anyway I was going through my ‚Äúself-improvement‚Äù phase and decided to buy this flask so I can drink about a gallon of water a day. Despite the fact that every trip to the bathroom sounded like Niagara Falls on crack it has done me well for the 8-9 months I‚Äôve had it.Or so I thought.One day on my way to a test I decided to make myself some ginger tea to rejuvenate myself. I put it in the flask and I noticed some leaks on the ‚Äúairtight‚Äù seal. Not a big deal. But after I finished drinking I washed it like THE CIVILIZED MAN I AM. And left it in the dishwasher for the next day. When I came back the smell of the flask sunk me to the gates of hell. It smelled like ginger farts and not the good kind. The smell remained for about a week before I completely got rid of it but I‚Äôm scared to make tea with it again.All in all solid product. Unfortunately I don‚Äôt BELIEVE bad smell is included in the warranty. If someone can get back to me I‚Äôd be more than happy. 
3, Overall is like any other. Main purpose was to use the different lids so I can pour in a cup... no matter what it always spills. 
3, I like it because it keeps my liquids hot/cold 
3, Great size straw feature is great; however people buy the double wall vacuum sealed bottles typically for the purpose of keeping drinks ultra cold. While drinks stay cold it is not as effective as it should be since ice does not remain and melts in less than 24 hours. Not the case with the name brand bottle we bought at the same time. 
3, My bottle came slightly damaged. It was scratched and dented. If it wasn‚Äôt for that I would have given this purchase 5 stars. 
3, Had this for two months. Was great at first but then the handle broke. It doesn‚Äôt close all the way now. 
3, Just received the water bottle. Cannot speak for how good it is yet but this is how the box was delivered. I know it is not the company's fault for what happens in transit but at least put tape on the box to make sure it will stay shut. So far not impressed but we will see how it works after it has been washed and starts getting used. 
3, Water bottle is great but doesn't keep ice for more than the day. I've had a water bottle keep ice for longer than this one. But still good for work. 
3, The bottle is great because it doesn‚Äôt leak and keeps your water cold the only problem I had was the lid strap broke after only having the bottle for a month. Doesn‚Äôt affect the lid except for now it isn‚Äôt attached to the bottle. 
3, No insulation 
3, For the price this is hard to beat. I use this in my office so it is being used in a climate controlled area. But it holds ice well is easy to drink from and to clean. Only issue thus far is the cap that holds the lid strap in place has broken already. So I had to take it off. Would get 4 stars if not for that. 
3, The black straw piece is crooked. Other than that it is wonderful. I love this product. 
3, Doesn‚Äôt keep my drink as cold as competitors. 
3, We bought two of these bottles. They keep our drinks cold all day and overall we love them and take them to work everyday. However this past week I have had a problem with one of the bottles we clean them everyday both the same way and never just let a drink sit in it overnight or anything like that. Last week one of our bottles started getting a off taste I have tried cleaning it with different things but I cannot get rid of the taste. I think it is coming from the lid but from where??? I have cleaned under the plastic ring and everything yet this taste is still there. It's really upsetting because I don't know what to do with it and I really enjoyed this bottle but at least my husband still has his for now. 
4, The colors are what attracted me at first. I‚Äôve tried many of the brands out there & I think (hope) this may be the ‚Äòone‚Äô. Due to Heath issues I have trouble gripping and holding items. I need a cup that has a place to grip or secure onto my hand or walker a secure lid (so when I do drop it involuntarily throw it the lid stays on) and one that keeps drinks cold. The beautiful colors to choose from were just a nice plus. I do think this will be the best for me. I‚Äôm going to splurge & order another color ü§ûü§ûü§ûupdate * love the cup hate the paracord handle. It‚Äôs extremely hard to put on 
4, Water 
4, Keeps liquids pretty cold 
4, Love it! Doesn‚Äôt keep my water as cold as hydro flask but honestly still does the job and way worth the price! Win 
4, Nice looking bottle. Keeps water cold. Must be hand washed. Comes with lots of tops. HOWEVER the 1 top I use the flip top no longer closes!!! Only had this bottle 6 weeks! VERY disappointed. HOPE the company sees this & replaces the top. 
4, Very pleased. Especially pleased that it‚Äôs half the price of a hydro. I have noticed the bottle losses suction and it‚Äôs harder to drink the last 1/3 of the water. But doable. 
4, This bottle is pretty and sturdy. It would be perfection if it fit in my cupholder in the car. Sadly it's too big so I can't secure it while taking it to and fro. 
4, I love this water bottle (and its size). It keeps things cold and the paint really doesn't chip much at all. I have however been disappointed with the straw lid as the spring clip has effectively broken and stopped working after only a year or so of use. Wish this quality would improve but this product is very decent overall. 
4, Leaks frequently but the ice last for an amazing period of time 
4, Great product everyone in house hold (kids) use them daily 
4, Package came open not sure if it has been used by someone else. Overall nice flask. Just disappointed it was not new/unused 
4, It was dropped by daughter. Lid shattered. Body did not dent. Sturdy metal. Plastic not so much. 
4, The straw function snap the 1st week. Wish i could order a replacement :( 
4, This bottle is PERFECT. Not only does it come with 3 different lids/tops it also comes with a replacement straw. The price alone sold me! It is sturdy and kept ice for about 14 hours today. It is sleek and sophisticated and I prefer it over my Yeti AND my Hidrate for sure. 
4, Bottle is very durable and has three different ways to drink it from. Default cap is easy to drink from and is leak proof majority of use. Haven‚Äôt had any trouble with cleaning it so far based on what‚Äôs recommended. Only minor thing about this water bottle I can say is that the base of it is very wide. So don‚Äôt expect it to fit in a normal cup holder. Better off placing it on the floor of your car or side door. Overall based on the volume of stuff you get plus a lifetime warranty on the bottle once you register it on the company website with your order number I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a stellar deal! If you are looking for a new modestly priced water bottle for everyday use; this may be a deal breaker for you! 
4, I really like this bottle visually it‚Äôs so pretty I haven‚Äôt had a leak so far but sometimes it‚Äôs super difficult to drink when I use the straw I even changed it but it‚Äôs still difficult to use it I didn‚Äôt like that it doesn‚Äôt come with brushes to clean the straw so it make it difficult to clean it 
4, Product seems well made. The kids love the different colors that were available. Only issue is that the straws are difficult to drink from. 
4, This is a great water bottle. I fill it with ice in the morning and maintains ice all day with several refills. I ordered one from this seller last year and was a little disappointed that they replaced the mouth piece with hard plastic instead of flexible material. 
4, Easy drinkleak proofeasy clean I already have a 18 oz one for about 6 mount. And it still working good. 
4, I do like this canister. Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be delivered in its actual box. Which is why I think it came dented in multiple spots thankfully I got mine slightly discounted. This fits exactly the amount it claims. It helps me during my shifts at work and I have used it every day. Color is pretty my husband picked it out. Definitely better that Hydroflask. Definitely recommend the carry cord! 
4, I have two of these bottles and some replacement lids and I have issues with all of the lids leaking. However I still think it's a good value for the bottle. 
4, So let me just start by saying I have this same water bottle in the narrow top version and I LOVE it. The starw is super smooth to drink from and it gets me to drink more water. I loved it so much I decided to get another one. I ordered this one without realizing the top was different so it comes with different lids. I honestly hate the straw lid this one comes with. It is hard to drink water from it so I use the flip lid instead but it's annoying having to invert this type of bottle to drink because they are kinda heavy. It's an overall nice water bottle and well worth the price. I would suggest getting the narrow one instead if you like using water bottles with straws. 
4, The bottle is great. I use it everyday but if I put water and a few ice cubes in it at 8am they are definitely half way melted by noon. This is not a problem for me but again this is not a 24 hours cold bottle. 
4, So cute and functional. I have one already now this new color! 
4, We‚Äôve bought several of these. They keep your drink super cold/hot for a long time. They dent super easy if you drop them. My husbands also started leaking after some time. We like them though. 
4, 64oz is too too big to handle 
4, Overall I like the bottle. It hasn't leaked keeps drinks cold for many hours and is easy to use. The only issue I have is that the bottle is that the base diameter is listed at 3.5 inches. It's actually just over 3.6 inches. I have a cupholder that will fit 3.5 but not 3.6. It's not a deal breaker but a little annoying. 
4, This is a terrific water bottle. It doesn‚Äôt taste like metal Keeps your water cold and the straws are a nice touch. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND hand washing the mouthpiece or it will taste like soap. The bottle is a bit brittle. Mine fell out of my truck when I went to grab it one day and now has a dent. That was day two of owning it so I was a bit bummed. That was only a three foot drop. Also for the cost they could include a tool to effectively clean the inside of the bottle. I clean my bottle every week and it is very difficult due to having the 64oz. Small drawbacks. But that is the reason for four stars. I would still highly recommend. It‚Äôs a great bottle and I would buy it again. 
4, This water bottle is very cute!! i love the color chive i chose and i like that it comes with two other different lids and 2 straws!! i would say in my opinion it‚Äôs better than a hydro flask in many ways because of the 1. color options and 2. the overall variety of things it comes with. the only small flaw was the tiny tiny dent on mi but i didn‚Äôt mind because this was a great purchase overall 
4, Almost too big but doubles as self-defense weapon. Great for cold. Haven‚Äôt tried hot stuff yet. 
4, Keep the liquid cold for long time 
4, Pretty awesome water bottle that does a great job at keeping your water cold. The three included lids make it a great value compared to other brands. My only complaint is that we were expecting a bright vibrant red bottle based on the photos but the bottle is actually a darker somewhat dull shade of red. But the bottle and lids were nice and I have already bought a couple more in different sizes and colors. 
4, i like it this flask in my workplace i have seen many water bottle but not like this one unique for its design and color my friend likes it... 
4, Water bottle is perfect! I wanted the flip lid because it's easier to clean and grab a quick drink during workouts but it is not leak proof so I have to make sure to keep it standing up at all times. Also wish it had a carrying ring or something with the flip lid because it is big to carry and not be able to throw in my bad and go it needs to be upright or it will spill. 
4, Great quality however a lot bigger than I expected. I had to order one size down. It no complaints other than that. Design is nice 
4, I love this waterbottle. I've had it for a couple months now and I've been staying hydrated thanks to it. I also bought my brother one as well! The only issue I have now is that I found it to leak a bit. I use the top with the straw and sometimes if I left it on the side or if it falls to the side I'll find water around it. I'm pretty sure I'm tightening it all the way so I don't know what the issue is. It's only recently happening. Maybe I'll try to find the reason why it's leaking and update this! 
4," This is very nice well built water bottle with a reasonable price relative to competitors. It insulates well and comes with three distinct tops.I liked the attention to detail: the top lines up well with the graphics on the bottle which is good when OCD kicks in.The reason for 4 stars is that the color is completely off what is shown on the site. The ""Fire Red"" I purchased is more of a flat dark brick-like red which is ok but not the nicer advertised red. "
4, Its little heavy as compared to other tumblers but i like it. 
4, I love it overall. Only issue is from carrying it by the handle caused a crease where the latch is located (believe this is from the the weight and carrying it from place to place caused to much pressure at that one point). Not worried about it but figured its important feedback. 
4, This is a great water bottle and reasonably priced. The only reason I took away a star is because I do not like the straw lid. It just feels weird in my mouth.I‚Äôm sure the average person wouldn‚Äôt have an issue with it and the volume (64 oz) and beautiful colour more than make up for my dissatisfaction with the straw.Again like most double walled water bottles it is heavy but is still comparable to the Hydroflask. 
4, My husband loves his flask easy to clean and put ice in for cold drinks and keeps cold for a long time haven‚Äôt tried warm yet 
4, I have bought three of these and for the price they are great! The only downside is they start leaking from the mouth piece after a few months. Every single bottle has been great for a while but then starts leaking every time you drink from it. I would still buy just know that you'll get 3 to 6 months out of it before needing to replace. 
4, I like it I use it everyday and I love it because the ice is still not melting the whole day 
4, Nice bottle I ordered one more 
4, Keeps the liquid cold. 
4, I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter because I was pleased with mine. The parents complained several times of leaking even with the spout closed and lid tight. I kinda felt bad this never happens. 
4, Purchased one of these for my mom for her birthday then another months later for my dads birthday; my dad carries around an old cooler to his job sites which is much larger so wasn‚Äôt sure if he‚Äôd like this or not (got them both 32oz). Turns out he loves it got them carrying straps and base-skins with them. They use them all-the-time. Recommended! 
4, Great water bottle. Love the color and a texture on the outside of it (it‚Äôs slightly grippy). The only thing that could be improved is to have the mouth piece be more like the ThermoFlask (softer). Other than that it‚Äôs a great bottle! 
4, The design is not exactly what it is advertised as they are advertising a narrow mouth but sent a Wide mouth.They sent the Left picture but advertise the right picture.That is ok because I suppose i prefer the wide mouth version.We will see how this affects the extended length of keeping things cool.Only had the bottle a day but it is very nice.Less expensive than other brands and comes with 3 different lids and includes multiple straws.The Lids are way worth being cheaper!!!This is an awesome bottle! 
4, My daughter takes this to school every day & loves it! 
5, Genuinely do not have any complaints. 
5, I invested in several hydro flask and while I still love them the price of this thing is just way better and it comes with 3 lids and works just as well.. 
5, This is a great water bottle. I throw it in my purse all the time without having to worry it leak. The straw feature is great and makes it very easy to drink. It also keeps water ice cold for hours which I love. The color is really nice too. It‚Äôs also very easy to clean. Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre supposed to put the straw in the dishwasher but I do anyway in the silverware rack and it cleans it easily. 
5, Awesome looking bottle  keeps drink cold for days even without ice  no hot stuff because I live in Florida! Lol! Great bottle!! 
5, Keeps liquids cold all day. Straw works great. 
5, This is a great water bottle! I bought the base and the handle set up with it. I have a couple Yeti bottles that are similar. This keeps things almost as cold as the Yeti. I had a challenge putting the ring on for the handle but followed the instructions and put the plastic ring in hot water and it helped. It‚Äôs still was a little tricky pulling it on but finally after soaking it the second time I was able to get it on. (If you don‚Äôt get it on ALL the way the bottle will not close all the way and it will leak!) 
5, I LOVE this water bottle! Its big enough that I dont have to keep refilling it every hour and the lid is big enough to put multiple ice cubes in at a time. 
5, I‚Äôve had this cup for awhile now and I will say it‚Äôs been great for helping me drink more water. Keeps it cold all day. Super durable I‚Äôve dropped it many times and it hasn‚Äôt even dented. Only down side is it does not fit in most cup holders. Other than that I love it and it still gets 5 stars 
5, I absolutely love it. Perfect for what I need it for and the straw feature helps make sure I drink my water 
5, Sturdy leak proof and the color/paint coating seems very high quality too. Keeps water cool throughout the day. The bottle arrived without any defects. The different lids are also a plus! 
5, I'm in love. I take this waterbottle with me everywhere and I love that it comes with three different lids although I only predominantly use the one with the built in straw. I drink a lot of water throughout the day so it is nice having a consistent 40oz water bottle that also keeps my water cold throughout the day. No complaints! 
5, Stays cold for very long time. Not dissatisfied 
5, Awesome! Keeps things really cold. Great accessories and helps me drink my two gallons a day! I‚Äôm definitely buying another! 
5, Keeps ice for over 12 hours. Comes with 3 different tops and extra straws so it's super easy to keep clean and drink from. 
5, I have not gone pee this much since I was a toddler. The color is very vibrant and the powercoat feels good in your hands. The gradient between orange and yellow is very smooth. All in all this thing is excellent and will be at my side for a good long while. 
5, Thank you I love it 
5, Bought it for my 18 year old son because he wanted a big hydroflask type bottle. He loves this one! Keeps water cold looks cool and has a built in spout handle to hold it and other lids to use. Great purchase! 
5, Love this water bottle!! I have a hydroflask already but would buy this one over a hydroflask. It‚Äôs a pretty design and comes with 3 different lid types. It‚Äôs easy to drink from and doesn‚Äôt spill as long as the spout is closed. Will probably buy another one in a different color in the future. 
5, I love the color quality and how cold this water bottle keeps my drinks. I have the 32 oz and I can go hours without having to fill the bottle back up. I will purchase maybe 2 more with the next being the 22 oz so that I can fit it into cup holders. 
5, Great cup stays cold comes with different attachments! Plus it‚Äôs pretty! 
5, This cup is amazing! It holds so much for how light it is. It's tipped over a few times and not a drop has spilled. It keeps things cold for hours cold like they just came out of the fridge. 
5, Love this cup and all the lids 
5, This 64 oz water bottle is AWSOME. There for you in time of need. Our friends decided too start a little fire pit for nice ambiance. The wind started to pick up a bit which started to make the fire grow. The fire caught onto the grass and my friend screamed ‚ÄòGET WATER‚Äô . I ran for my bottle nicely full and cold while she got a pot of water from her sink which didn‚Äôt have a lot of pressure. She was able to put the fire out on the grass and the water bottle was able too safely put the rest of the fire pit out. Thank you for this 64 oz of goodness. 
5, I got the 40 oz bottle along with the paracord handle and silicone cover for bottom....the whole set is amazing and water bottle keeps water really cold. 
5, Considering I‚Äôve been doing weightlifting now for the past 12 years and actually turn pro bodybuilder this is by far my favorite water jug I‚Äôve ever had.I love having a 64 ounce water bottle so that I can fill in at 2 to 3 times a day knowing that I got my gallon in without caring around a gallon because that is annoyingMy husband actually ended up getting a Hydro flask prior to me finding this brand and he ended up switching over to iron class because so much better product. You get two separate straws attachment. Which Hydro flask you have to buy separately.Do yourself and get the Perry cord handle as well. It‚Äôs only seven dollars to add onto it 
5, First thing I did was fill it full of ice and let it sit over night. It was still full of ice the next morning. It would keep my water cold all day. I love the handle on the straw top. It‚Äôs very easy and comfortable to carry with two fingers even when it‚Äôs full. My one year old tests the durability almost daily it holds up! I got the 40oz Bottle it‚Äôs the perfect size for my water needs. I love the color! I highly recommend!! Please mark if you have found my review useful. 
5, Holds temperature as advertised. Big mouth makes filling easy and the multiple tops are great as I use the stainless steel top for hot drinks and straw top for cold. 
5, I like to put ice water in this bottle before I go to bed and it keeps it cold into the next day. It holds about what I drink in a 24 hour period of time so I am no longer back and forth to the fridge 4 times a day to refill my smaller bottles which I love! I also think the gradient is cuter than the solid hydroflasks out there and can't imagine that there's enough of a quality difference to make it worth the price over this one. Highly recommend! 
5, Ordered the white super cute and elegant looking. Ordered the half gallon size to help achieve water intake goals. Just ordered the black as well! 
5, Love this! I fill it halfway with ice in the morning before work and can keep refilling it with water during the day. The ice will last until I get home at night. I‚Äôm drinking more water now so that‚Äôs a plus. 
5, Love Iron Flask products however the cap with the straw came damaged and I was unable to use the straw. 
5, No condensation at all and I love that the 22oz fits in the cup holder of my car! Will be buying another one. 
5, Fantastic product! I use it all day long at the job 
5, Great water bottle! Still had ice in it after 7 hours at work! 
5, The top keep the liquid a little and you have to make sure is in the upright position 
5, I find this water bottle is good and durable. I dropped it quite a few times and only took small dents. Not to mention they send a few different tops with it. 
5, Best bottle I have purchased to date. I carry it with me everywhere I go and it keeps my water cold for a long time. I definitely recommend this bottle to anyone. 
5, I like the color and the fact that it keeps my water cold for over 8 hours. 
5, Got the 32oz as a gift for my dad to replace his other bottle and he loves it he carries it around the house with him and uses it all day 
5, We bought this because our dog ate my husband's camel back. He only likes cold water so I recommend a hydroflask or something similar. We found this and it seemed to be the perfect fit. My husband is super happy with the purchase! Color is amazing and water stays cool for hours. Would definitely buy again. 
5, These sports water bottles are perfect! 
5, Literally my favorite water bottle I‚Äôve ever owned. It keeps my water cold and fits right into my purse!! It really helps me to drink enough water throughout the day. I have the 32 oz bottle but am planning on getting more! 
5, A great bottle. Keeps my drink cold even without ice for hours. I love how it looks and the durability. It comes with 3 different lids so you can choose what you like best. Mine doesn't fit in a cup holder but does have a hook to latch onto my bag. Absolutely would buy again! 
5, Perfect size and cool look for aMiddle schooler! 
5, Keeps water cold all day no problems with the straw option love it 
5, Great product love the different tops that come with it. 
5, This bottle keeps ice cold for the whole day! It does what it says. It comes with two interchangeable to which I like. 
5, I thought that I‚Äôve owned some nice water bottles in the past but compared to these they were nothing! I got the 40 oz and it is QUALITY from the packaging the design  the materials and the functionality. Now I‚Äôm sippin on 40‚Äôs all day long 
5, By far my favorite water bottle I have ever purchased! It‚Äôs so pretty and high quality! I added a cute decal to mine and even got the carrying strap and pink top! 
5, Can hold ice for 24+ hours so I always have cold water! I can lay it sideways in my car and it doesn‚Äôt spill at all. The lid screws in easily as well. Definitely buying a few more as gifts!
